Retroweaver - Use the language of the future, now
-------------------------------------------------

"Are you a Java developer who's excited about the new JDK 1.5 language 
features? Does your heart race when you think about generics and parametric 
polymorphism? Do extended for loops make you feel warm and fuzzy inside? 
Do thoughts of autoboxing and static imports permeate your dreams?

Then let me welcome you to Retroweaver. Retroweaver is a bytecode weaver 
that enables you to take advantage of the new Java 1.5 language features, 
while still retaining total binary compatability with 1.4 virtual machines. 
Retroweaver operates by transforming Java class files compiled by a 1.5 
compiler into version 1.4 class files which can then be run on any 1.4 
virtual machine.

So, when your favorite vendor tells you that their application server won't
be supporting JDK 1.5 until 2007, or your customers won't have JDK 1.5 for 
years to come, or your manager refuses to begin development on a beta JDK, 
put Retroweaver to work for you."

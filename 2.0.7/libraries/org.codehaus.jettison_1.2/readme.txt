Jettison - JSON StAX Implementation
-----------------------------------

"Jettison is a collection of Java APIs (like STaX and DOM) which read 
and write JSON. This allows nearly transparent enablement of JSON based 
web services in services frameworks like CXF or XML serialization 
frameworks like XStream.

There are currently two included conventions for mapping JSON to XML. 
The first, is BadgerFish which implements the full XML infoset in JSON 
using various techniques. The second, is called the "mapped" convention. 
It allows you to manually map XML namespaces to JSON element prefixes."

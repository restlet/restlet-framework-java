## The first REST API framework for Java

Thanks to Restlet Framework's powerful routing and filtering capabilities, unified client and server Java API, developers can build secure and scalable RESTful web APIs.

It is available in editions for all major platforms (Java SE/EE, Google App Engine, OSGi, GWT, Android) and offers numerous extensions to fit the needs of all developers.

It is available under the terms of either the Apache Software License 2.0 or the Eclipse Public License 1.0.

Restlet-GWT is a client-side module that is able to invoke RESTful Web Applications from a 
<a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/">GWT</a> front-end. It is actually a port of a subset of the 
<a target="_top" href="/documentation/@version-minor@/api/">Restlet API for Java</a> to GWT 1.5 
(Google Web Toolkit) and above. Restlet is a framework dedicated to the REST architectural style.<br/>
<br/>
The Restlet framework is led by <a target="_top" href="http://www.noelios.com">Noelios Technologies</a>
with the help of the Restlet community.

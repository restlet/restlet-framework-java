- 1.1 Milestone 5 (2008-08-07)
    - Security warning
        - The handling of Context has been significantly refactored in 
          this release. A new Context#createChildContext() method has
          been added to create a new isolated child context from a 
          parent component's context. Application(Context) constructor
          doesn't wrap the given context anymore. Attach methods on
          virtual hosts and internal component router now automatically
          set the child context on the target application is a null 
          context is detected.
    - Bugs fixed
        - Allowed subclasses of StatusService to get the throwable 
          that generate the error in getRepresentation() method. 
          Reported by Loic Mathieu.
        - The Servlet adapter now stops the whole Component instead
          of just the Application.
        - Fixed Apache HttpClient extension bug regarding multiple 
          headers. Reported by Stephan Koops.
        - Fixed potential concurrency issues in Response and
          WrapperList/Series/Form. Reported by Stephan Koops.
        - Fixed potential NPE when using Velocity with template 
          representations having no modification date. Reported by 
          Evan Worley.
        - Moved generation of entries at the the end of Atom feeds. 
          Reported by Bruno Harbulot.
        - Fix potential NPE in Template class. Reported by Ralf
          Bommersbach
        - Fixed bug in HTTP client connectors causing a null response
          entity to be returned when no entity headers were found but
          when chunked encoding was detected.
        - Each connector now has its own instance of Context to allow
          setting of different parameter values on different 
          connectors.
        - Fixed issue with character sets and proxies where a character
          set could be written twice in HTTP headers. Reported by Alex
          Milowski.
        - The Router.defaultMatchQuery property wasn't properly taken
          into account by the Route class. Now it sets the default 
          value for Route.matchQuery property.
        - Fixed bug in Grizzly connector causing some requests to hand.
          Contributed by Bruno Harbulot.
    - API Enhancements
        - Added a "Request.originalRef" property containing the URI 
          reference originally requested by the client. Clarified the
          purpose of "Request.resourceRef". Suggested by Alex Milowski
          and Rob Heittman.
        - Client now has a new constructor taking a string with the 
       	  protocol name instead of a Protocol instance.
       	- Replaced "Response.challengeRequest" by "challengeRequests" 
       	  list property to conform to HTTP semantics. Contributed by
       	  Bruno Harbulot.
       	- Clarified concurrency constraints on Uniform/Restlet 
       	  subclasses and on Resource class. 
       	  Suggested by Bruno Harbulot.
       	- Added public Resource#getAllowedMethods() method.
       	- Allow the routing of URIs with or without taking into 
       	  account the query part. Suggested by Jim Alateras and 
       	  contributed by Bruno Dumon.
       	- Completed the Component's XML config with the default query 
       	  match setting defined on routers. Suggested by Bruno Dumon.
       	- Replaced the Context#getThread(Runnable) method with a more
       	  flexible org.restlet.service.TaskService class and a new
       	  "taskService" property on Application. Many design 
       	  contributions from Tim Peierls. Suggestions by Kevin Conaway.
       	- Clarified Javadocs for static getCurrent() methods. Suggested
       	  by Patrick Logan.
       	- Replaced Map<String, Object> parameters by Map<String, ?>
       	  in Template and Resolver classed. Suggested by Leigh Klotz.
       	- Added shortcut Route#getMatchingMode() and setMatchingMode()
       	  methods that redirect calls to the "template" property.
       	- Documented the default matching mode on Router.
       	- Deprecated Context#setLogger() as there is no compelling use
       	  for it and synchronized setParameters() and setAttributes()
       	  methods. Updated Javadocs of Context related to concurrent
       	  access and modifications of those collections. Suggested by
       	  Tim Peierls.
       	- Added HTTP OAuth authentication scheme constant.
       	- Completed the Component's XML config with the support of 
       	  parameters under the component, client and server elements. 
       	  Reported by Bruno Harbulot.
       	- Added a org.restlet.service.Service class, super class of all
       	  existing service classes, with "enabled" and "started" 
       	  properties. Enabled services are automatically started by
       	  their parent application or component.
       	- Added an org.restlet.data.Range class to represent content
       	  ranges.
       	- Added "enabledCipherSuites" and "disabledCipherSuites" 
       	  parameters to HTTPS connectors supporting those settings.
       	  Contributed by Bruno Harbulot.

          content available. Corresponds to Content-Range HTTP header.
          Also added a getAvailableSize() to return the range size in
          case it is set, or getSize() otherwise.
        - Added a RangeService class and an Application.rangeService
          property to control to automatic handling of range of 
          response entities.
        - Added "resumeUpload" and "temporaryExtension" properties on
          the Directory class to enable resumable uploads. This 
          limit the number of concurrent uploads on the same file to
          one client at a time. 
    - NRE and Extension Enhancements
        - Added a static HttpServletRequest getRequest(Request) method
          to the Servlet extension.
        - DirectoryResource now exposes isDirectoryTarget() and 
          isFileTarget() methods. Suggested by Jean-Yves Cronier.
        - Enhanced WADL extension to support all WADL description 
          properties and both formatting and parsing. Also added new
          WadlRepresentation and WadlResource classes to facilitate the
          description of Resources as WADL documents. 
          Sponsored by NetDev Ltd (http://www.netdev.co.uk).
        - The Apache HTTP Client extension can now have a retry handler
          parameter set. Suggested by Sanjay Acharya.
        - Added a "sslContextFactory" parameter and attribute to HTTPS 
          connectors to improve the flexibility of SSL configuration. If
          this parameter isn't set, the previous parameters are used 
          instead. Contributed by Bruno Harbulot.
        - Exceptions occuring while writing the response entities are 
          now reported as severe errors instead of just info messages.
          Broken connections are still reported as info messages to 
          reduce log size. Contributed by Bruno Dumon.
        - Made the com.noelios.ext.ssl extension public to provide more 
          flexibility in configuring SSL certificates. Depends on 
          jSSLutils library 0.4. Contributed by Bruno Harbulot.
        - Added a port of Restlet to GWT. This is a subset of the 
          Restlet API and Engine, mostly the client side working on top
          of GWT 1.5 RC1.
        - Slightly refactored and documented OAuth extension.
        - Renamed the "org.restlet.ssl.hostnameVerifier" attribute into
          just "hostnameVerifier" for consistency with existing naming.
        - SpringBeanRouter can now search beans in ancestors. 
          Contribution from James Maki.
        - JaxbRepresentation now takes into account its "characterSet"
          property to set the "jaxb.encoding" property on the JAXB 
          marshaller internally used. Reported by Sanjay Acharya.
    - Misc
        - Refactored WAR client to remove remaining class in NRE core.
        - Refactored OSGi support to not require one activator for each
          bundle/extension anymore. Only the NRE bundle has an activator 
          which introspects the installed bundles for the usual 
          descriptor files in "META-INF/services" directories. Suggested
          by Hendy Irawan.

- 1.1 Milestone 4 (2008-05-20)

          available for the response status. Reported by Stephan Koops.
        - Fixed potential NPE in request processing code when a request
          was not fully set (missing properties like the method).
        - Fixed issues with chunked encoding and socket closing. 
          Contributed by Kevin Conaway.
        - Fixed potential NPE in ApplicationClientDispatcher. Reported
          by Alex Milowski.
        - Series.getValues() was not respecting the 'ignoreCase' 
          parameter. Contributed by Stephan Koops.

          Reported by Michael B?ckling.
    - API Enhancements
        - Matrix parameters are now fully supported by the Reference 
          and the Form classes. Added many new methods, similar to the
          ones available for query strings.
        - File-like extensions are now fully supported by the Reference
          class. See getExtensions(), getExtensionsAsArray() and setter
          methods. 
        - Added Reference.hasExtensions(), hasFragment(), hasMatrix(), 
          hasQuery() and hasScheme() methods.
        - Matrix parameters are now ignored by tunnel service. 
          Contributed by Stephan Koops.
        - Refactored the TunnelService implementation, renamed the 
          "extensionTunnel" to "extensionsTunnel" and added the
          "queryTunnel" property for consistency. Suggested by Chuck 
          Mortimer.
        - Deprecated the Restlet.init() method. In Restlet 1.2, this 
          method will be removed and its logic directly put in the
          handle(Request, Response) method.
        - Added static Response.getCurrent()/setCurrent() and Request.
          getCurrent() methods. Implementation based on thread local
          variables updated by component and applications when they
          handle a request/response couple. Suggested by Stephan Koops.
        - Added new Response.setStatus() methods and new Status 
          constructors for more flexibility in setting status with 
          associated exceptions.
        - Ensured the all NRE core and extensions classes properly pass
          the throwable/exceptions to the error statuses so they can be
          later retrieved or printed. Suggested by Steve Loughran.  
        - Added support for new RIAP authority: HOST to issue requests 
          relative to the current virtual host. 
          Suggested by Rob Heittman.
        - Added APPLICATION_ALL_XML constant and proper changes to the
          MediaType.includes() to recognize those patterns. Contributed
          by Stephan Koops.
        - Moved shared initialization logic of Resource constructor ands
          init() method into initialization block.
        - Static valueOf() methods now treat "" as null.
        - Added connectTimeout attribute on both Client and 
          ClientHelper classes. Reported by Avi Flax.
        - Added static "current" property on Application and 
          VirtualHost returning the instance associated with the 
          current thread.
        - Added Context.getThread(Runnable) method to centralize usage
          of thread (potentially doing some pooling and currently 
          copying the thread local variables).
        - Deprecated Context.getApplication(). Use static method
          Application.getCurrent() instead.
        - Removed several unecessary throw clauses in ByteUtils and 
          added some missing Javadocs. Contributed by Stephan Koops.
     - NRE and Extension Enhancements
        - Atom extension is now able to write Feed and Service XML
          documents and not just reading/parsing them. This can be used
          to return Atom feeds as representations.
        - Added Velocity's RepresentationTemplateLoader class and a new
          constructor to TemplateRepresentation which allows the 
          processing of a Velocity template provided as a Restlet
          Representation.
        - Deprecated Protocol.SMTP_STARTTLS, replaced by a "startTls" 
          parameter on JavaMail connector.
        - Added Protocol.POP and POPS constants.
        - Added ChallengeScheme.POP_BASIC (USER+PASS) and POP_DIGEST 
          (APOP) constants.
        - Added support for POP v3 and POP/SSL v3 to the JavaMail 
          connector and refactored existing code. 
          Sponsored by RunMyProcess (http://www.runmyprocess.com).
        - The debugging mode of the JavaMail connector is now optional
          and can be changed with a connector parameter "debug".
        - Refactored the JavaMail connector to separate the message 
          parsing and formatting into three new classes: 
          MessageRepresentation, MessagesRepresentation and 
          RepresentationMessage. Suggested by Matthieu Hug.
        - Added an ObjectFactory to the JAX-RS extension for customized
          root resource class and provider instantiation. Contributed
          by Bruno Dumon.
        - The local connectors (FILE and CLAP connectors for now) have 
          a new "defaultLanguage" parameter that is uses when no parent
          application is available (no MetadataService accessible).
          Limitation reported by Jules Milner-Brage.
        - Added SslContextFactory and DefaultSslContextFactory to the
          com.noelios.restlet.util package. Contributed by Bruno 
          Harbulot.
    - Misc

        - Improved logging consistency.
        - Expressed the Eclipse plugin dependencies using the
          "Import-Package" instructions instead of "Required-Bundle".
        - All connector and authentication modules now have OSGi 
          activator to automatically register themselves with the 
          engine. The engine module also registers itself with the API.
          Suggested by Hendy Irawan, with help from Edward Yakop.
        - Updated db4o 7.2 to latest stable build.
        - Added Spring example based on REST book chapter 7. 
          Contributed by Konstantin L?ufer.

          using ServletServer or a subclass. 
        - Made javax.servlet.* dependencies optional for the fileupload
          extension. Reported by Hendy Irawan.

 - 1.1 Milestone 3 (2008-04-01)
    - Bugs fixed
        - Fixed setRedirectRef(String) method which wasn't supporting 
          relative URIs when no base reference was available on the 
          resource reference. Now it uses the resource reference 
          instead. Reported by Steve Loughran.
        - Made the SpringApplication constructor public. Reported by 
          Peter Neubauer.
        - The AWS authentication wasn't properly detected by the
          engine. Reported by Steve Loughran.

          and fixed by Rhett Sutphin.
        - Fixed socket closing issues with the internal HTTP 
          connectors. Reported and fixed by Kevin Conaway.
        - Fixed potential NPE in CLAP connector. Reported by Rob 
          Heittman. 
        - Fixed potential NPE in Freemarker extension when the 
          template is provided under the form of a representation.
        - Request.getProtocol() now returns the protocol of the 
          targetRef instead of the baseRef when the targetRef itself is
          absolute. Patch contributed by Jeroen Goubert (Schaubroeck).
        - When using new Reference(baseref, "absolute-path"), calling 
          getTargetRef() now returns a reference with the baseRef 
          cleared. Patch contributed by Jeroen Goubert (Schaubroeck).
    - API Enhancements
        - Added OAuth extension as a pluggable authentication scheme.
          Contributed by Adam Rosien.
        - Added XDB extension providing integration with Oracle 
          embedded JVM. Contributed by Marcelo Ochoa.
        - Made the org.restlet.util.Resolver generic and used it in 
          Guard to allow the user to provide a secret resolver without
          needing to subclass Guard.
        - DomRepresentation.getDocument() now creates a new empty 
          document if no document is available or can't be parsed.
        - Reference class now enforces the usage of valid URI 
          characters only. Suggested by Avi Flax.
        - Static methods added to Reference: isGenericDelimiter(char),
          isReserved(char), isSubDelimiter(char), isUnreserved(char)
          and isValid(char).   
        - DomRepresentation now has a protected createTransformer()
          method that can be overridden to customize the properties of
          the JAXP Transformer. Contributed by Rob Heittman.
        - All getters in Reference returning URI encoded string now
          have an additional method taking a 'decode' parameter. 
          Suggested by Paul J. Lucas.
        - TransformRepresentation can now be reused multiple times by 
          multiple threads in parallel. Contributed by Marc Portier.
        - Parameters and output properties can now be set on the 
          TransformRepresentation and are automatically passed to the 
          created JAXP Transformers. Suggested by Marc Portier and
          Joe Nellis.
        - Added new constructors to TransformRepresentation making the
          creation of the internal URI resolver optional and allowing
          to pass a JAXP Templates precompiled instance directly.
          Suggested by Joe Nellis. 
        - Added Context.getCurrent() and setCurrent(..) static methods
          based on a thread local variable. The static property is also
          updated when Component and Application instances are handling
          a call. This can be useful to get access to the context even
          when it isn't possible to manually pass it down the call 
          stack. 
        - Added a new constructor to Client and Server allowing to 
          specify the class name of the connector to use. Suggested by
          Dan Diephouse.
        - Added a "getValuesArray(String name):String[]" method on the
          Series class. Suggested by Paul J. Lucas.
        - Method getDocumentBuilder() on XmlRepresentation is now 
          protected, allowing reuse by subclasses like 
          JaxbRepresentation, JibxRepresentation or DomRepresentation.
        - Method XmlRepresentation.getSource() was renamed to 
          getStreamSource() and new getSaxSource() and getDomSource()
          methods were added. DomRepresentation has an optimized 
          implementation of getDomSource() and SaxRepresentation was
          refactored to support this approach as well with many new
          constructors added. Suggested by Marc Portier.
        - TransformRepresentation has been refactored to support SAX
          pipelining when multiple TransformRepresentation are nested.
          Suggested by Marc Portier. 
        - Added a getValuesMap() method to the Series class.
        - Added "authenticated" property on ChallengeResponse and 
          refactored Guard and engine to update this property upon
          authentication. 
        - Added getPrincipal() method on ChallengeResponse.
        - Added support of client preferences tunnelling by extensions.
          Suggested by Chuck Mortimore and contributed by Stephan 
          Koops.
    - NRE and Extension Enhancements
        - Made the ServerServlet.create*() method protected instead of 
          public.
        - Added a ServerServlet.createCall() and createWarClient() 
          methods for easier subclassing by the XDB extension. 
          Some contributions from Marcelo Ochoa.
        - Added new javax.annotation library for the JAX-RS extension.
        - Added ServerServlet.getClass() method to facilitate 
          subclassing by the XDB extension. Suggested by Marcelo Ochoa.
        - Added new constructors to JiBX extension not requiring the
          binding name parameter.
        - Distributed experimental JAX-RS extension implementing the
          JSR-311 draft specification. Contributed by Stephan Koops.
        - All HTTP server connectors now expose the client certificates
          using the "org.restlet.https.clientCertificates" request 
          attribute. Contributed by Bruno Harbulot.
        - Updated Java Activation Framework to version 1.1.1.
        - Updated JavaMail library to version 1.4.1.
        - Removed the SpringApplication class as an XML configuration
          alternative is now documented. 
        - Updated db4o to version 7.2 with transparent activation 
          and update.
        - Improve logging for internal HTTP server when created thread
          throw uncaught exceptions. Contributed by Kevin Conaway.
        - HTTPS server connectors expose new attributes related 
          to SSL: "org.restlet.https.cipherSuite" and 
          "org.restlet.https.keySize". Contributed by Bruno Harbulot.
        - Improved the Grizzly connector to support returning chunked
          responses.
    - Misc
        - Reformatting of the changes log. Contributed by Avi Flax.
        - All Component subclasses now use a main method that throws 
          exceptions and takes a string array as parameter.
        - More precise log message for a Resource with no variant.
        - Otpimized Eclipse dependencies by leveraging reexport option.
        - Updated Spring to version 2.5.2.
        - Improved handling of connectors created without a protocol.
          Contributed by Avi Flax.
        - Representations returned by the CLAP connector now have their
          modification date set if it is based on a file. Suggested by
          Keke.
        - Refactored and improved logging for Guard and challenge
          processing. Suggested by Alex Milowski.
        - Updated Reference's Javadocs to mention that getters do not 
          automatically do URI decoding. Suggested by Paul J. Lucas.
        - Refactored NRE helpers hiearchy to take advantage of generics
          and remove duplications.
        - Added SSL unit test contributed by Bruno Harbulot.
        - Completed the list of known media-types with Tomcat's 
          entries. Reported and contributed by Alex Milowski.
        - The engine can now registers an URLStreamHandlerFactory 
          adapter on the java.net.URL class that is based on the 
          current context as retrieved via Context.getCurrent() 
          method. 
        - Added condition on javadocs flag for the stage-classic task 
          in the Ant build script. reported by Kevin Conaway.
        - Changed licensing scheme to a choice between CDDL 1.0, LGPL
          3.0 or LGPL 2.1.
        - Ensured that all the framework (API, Engine and extensions) 
          are thread safe, especially the representation and
          the request/reponse related ones. This will allow the usage
          of separate reader / worker / writer threads to work on the
          same request/response cycle. Reported by Tim Peierls.

 - 1.1 Milestone 2 (2008-02-29)
    - Bugs fixed
        - Fixed NPE in Connector class. Reported by Rob Heittman and
          fixed by Tim Peierls.
        - WriterRepresentation was missing a default implementation for
          getReader() abstract method.
        - If an error is found in HttpClientHelper.sendRequest(),
          StreamClientHelper ignores it and continues to parse the
          response when it should stop processing. Fixed by Kevin
          Conaway.
        - Status.isSuccess(), is*Error(), isRedirection() and isInfo()
          methods now support status classes as specified in HTTP 1.1.
          Reported by Paul J. Lucas.

        - Fixed issue in SpringHost preventing usage of the
          setRoutes(Map) method. Replaced with a setAttachments(Map)
          method. Added Javadocs example. Reported by Simon Olofsson.
        - ResourceException wasn't setting a message. Reported by Derek
          Chiles.
        - Representation.isAvailable() now returns false if the size is
          '0'.
        - Refactoring of HTTP server connectors code to better deal
          with HEAD request, 1xx, 204, 205, 304 status codes. Issues
          reported by Alex Milowski.
        - Ensured all modifiable collections are properly documented in
          the API. Suggested by Stephan Koops.
        - Fixed Spring XML loading issue related to validation in
          SpringContext class.
        - Fixed bug with the FileClientHelper returning wrong list of
          variants. Reported by Iestyn Evans.
        - Fixed bug in Tag.equals() implementation. Reported by Stephan
          Koops.
        - Fixed NPE in the WAR client of the Servlet extension.
          Reported by Jason Terhune.
        - Caught exception with Simple connector when flushing a closed
          stream. Now it is logged at a lower priority. Reported by
          Todd Nguyen.
        - Fixed NPE in the MediaTypes class. Reported and contributed
          by Marc Portier.
        - Fixed bug in SpringComponent preventing setting of clients.
          Reported by Garriot Zhang.
        - Fixed several bugs related to Grizzly (chunked encoding not
          working, restarting NPE, etc.).
    - API Enhancements
        - Deprecated Status.isInfo(), replaced by isInformational() to
          follow HTTP naming.
        - Removed unecessary 'synchronized' keyword on
          Application.createRoot() and added one to the setRoot()
          method. Reported by Tim Peierls.
        - Added support for Alpha-numerical sorting of index pages in
          Directory. Suggested by Davide Angelocola based on David
          Koelle's original idea. Optimized implementation contributed
          by Rob Heittman from Solertium Corporation. New
          setComparator, setAlphaComparator and setAlphaNumComparator
          methods added. The default sorting is now "AlphaNum".
        - Synchronized some list setters on Component and Connector
          with explanation in Javadocs as suggested by Tim Peirls.
        - Guard.checkSecret() method now has a Request parameter.
          Suggested by Alex Milowski.
        - Added new constructors to CookieSetting. Contributed by
          Stephan Koops.
        - Filter.beforeHandle() and doHandle() methods can now
          indicates if the processing should continue normal, go to the
          afterHandle() method directly or stop immediately. IMPORTANT
          NOTE: as it isn't possible to add a return parameter to an
          existing method, the change can break existing filters. In
          this case, you just need to return the "CONTINUE" constant
          from your method and use "int" as return parameter. Issue
          reported by Paul J. Lucas.
        - Added Handler.getQuery() method to easily return the
          request's target resource reference query as a parsed form
          (series of parameters). Suggested by Kevin Conaway.
        - Added a Reference.clone() method. Contributed by Stephan
          Koops.
        - Added more fine-grained lifecycle for Components with new
          start*() and stop*() methods. Suggested by a discussion with
          Alex Milowski.
        - Added Component.updateHosts() method to update the routes
          after dynamic changes to virtual hosts. Suggested and
          contributed in part by Alex Milowski.
        - Added format(Object) and resolve(Object,String) methods to
          Template to allow for custom variable resolution. Enhancement
          suggested by Stephan Koops.
        - Added "defaultMatchingMode" property on Router. Suggested by
          William Pietri.
        - Added "throwable" property to the Status class, respecting
          the immutability. Suggested by Paul J. Lucas.
        - Added "getEphemeralPort()" method on Server to get the local
          port actually used by the system when the "port" property is
          set to '0'. Suggested by William Pietri.
        - Made the inner Template.VariableResolver interface and
          "format(VariableResolver)" method public. Suggested by
          Stephan Koops for the JAX-RS extension.
        - Added static Representation.createEmpty() method to return a
          new empty representation.
        - Added Variable.TYPE_URI_PATH to match any path character
          except in the query or fragment parts. Suggested by Stephan
          Koops and Michael Makunas.
        - Added MediaType.APPLICATION_ATOM_SERVICE_XML constant.
        - Added TEXT_JAVASCRIPT media type constant. Suggested by
          Evgeny Shepelyuk.
        - Added MediaType.getMostSpecific(), isCompatible() and
          isConcrete() methods. Contributed by Stephan Koops.
    - NRE and Extension Enhancements

          Map. Suggested by Evgeny K. Shepelyuk and Sean Landis
        - Updated Spring to version 2.5
        - Updated db4o to version 7.0
        - Added a new parameter to ServerServlet allowing specification
          of a custom component to instantiate.
        - Added the ability to specify a hostname verifier for the
          HTTPS client based on JDK's net package. Contributed by Alex
          Milowski.
        - Improved robustness of Reference when starting with an empty
          URI. Contributed by Stephan Koops.
        - Added new Spring NRE extension containing a
          SpringServerServlet facilitating the Servlet + Spring +
          Restlet trio integration. Contributed by Florian Schwarz.
          Also new classes where contributed by Rhett Sutphin that give
          even more integration option (RestletFrameworkServlet,
          SpringBeanFinder and SpringBeanRouter).
        - Added JiBX extension, alternative to JAXB. Contributed by
          Florian Schwarz.
        - Added support for nested resources in WadlComponent.
          Contributed by Avi Flax.
        - Resources with no variant set now log a warning on GET
          requests. Contributed by Avi Flax.
        - Updated and tested the Atom extension to conform to the
          latest APP specifications. The extension currently allows to
          retrieve an APP Service Document and Atom Feeds.
        - Lowered the logging level for some Simple IO exceptions.
        - Updated JSON JAR to latest version.
        - Externalized mappings between file extensions and media types
          in the MetadataService. Reported by Alex Milowsky.
        - Closed an open BufferedReader in IdentClient class.
        - Updated FreeMarker to version 2.3.12.
        - Added support for DIGEST authentication (client and server
          side). Contributed by Ray Waldin.
        - Added a WadlApplication class and refactored the
          WadlComponent to support many more usage scenarios:
            - WadlApplication instances can now be added to existing
              components. 
            - WadlApplication instances can be modified to add filters
              in front of the root router 
            - WADL description documents can be retrieved via HTTP or
              other protocols 
            - Only the necessary client connectors are automatically
              created
        - Guard is now setting a Principal instance after
          authorization. Contributed by Stephan Koops.
        - Refactored engine to support pluggable authentication.
        - Updated Grizzly to version 1.7.2
    - Misc
        - Added Engine.copyResponseHeaders() method. Contributed by
          Stephan Koops.
        - Handlers now return a SERVER_INTERNAL_ERROR instead of
          CLIENT_NOT_FOUND when no next Restlet is attached to them.
          Suggested by Paul J. Lucas.
        - Added Engine.formatCookie(), formatCookieSetting() and
          equivalent parse*() methods. Contributed by Stephan Koops for
          the JAX-RS implementation.
        - Updated HTTP server connectors behaviour in the purpose to
          avoid the sending of entity when the entity is empty, when
          the status explicitely forbids the sending of entity (e.g.
          1xx, etc), or when the method must not send entity (e.g.
          HEAD).
        - Updated HTTP client connectors behaviour in the purpose to
          close aggressively the connection in several identified cases
          when the status explicitely forbids the sending of entity
          (e.g. 1xx, etc), when the method must not send entity (e.g.
          HEAD), or when the Content-Length header's value is 0.
        - Ensure that the headers of the response's entity will be
          retrieved even if no message body has been sent (in this
          case, an empty representation is created).
        - Tutorial examples based on applications are now runnable with
          the Servlet adapter. Suggested by Marcelo Ochoa.
        - RIAP request are now considered confidential when dispatched.
          Suggested by Rob Heittman.

- 1.1 Milestone 1 (2007-12-24)
    - Bugs fixed
        - Overridden the StringRepresentation#setCharacterSet method,
          in order to refresh the size of the representation. Reported
          by Calvin Cheng.
        - Fixed issue in the selection of connectors. The last
          connector in the classpath for a given protocol was selected
          instead of the first one, leading to counter-intuitive
          behavior when multiple connectors were present in the
          classpath.
        - Fixed bug in DomRepresentation causing the loss of both
          public and system DocTypes. Reported by Lee Saferite.
        - Fixed path error in test cases module. Reported by Sean
          Landis, contributed by Alex Milowski.
        - SaxRepresentation constructors don't throw IOException
          anymore. Reported by Paul J. Lucas.
        - Fixed multi-threading issues. Reported by Tim Peierls. Some
          contributions by Kevin Conaway.
        - Renamed the HTTP_AWS challenge scheme into HTTP_AWS_S3 as
          there are changes for each existing Amazon Web Service.
          Reported by Guy Ernest.
    - API Enhancements
        - Added Response.locationRef property as a replacement for the
          Response.redirectRef property that is now deprecated.
          Suggested by Michael Vogel and Avi Flax.
        - The ConverterService and all related methods on Message are
          deprecated, with no replacement as it doesn't fit well with
          content negotiation. Most users prefer to handle those
          conversion in Resource subclasses. Suggested by Justin
          Makeig, Rob Heittman, Sumit Lohia.
        - Added a getApplication() method to Context and Resource
          classes.
        - Added abstract CharacterRepresentation for representations
          based on character streams.
        - Added ReaderRepresentation for representations based on
          characters Readers.
        - Added WriterRepresentation for representations based on
          characters Writers.
        - Added ByteUtils.toString(Reader) method and refactored
          ByteUtils.toString(InputStream) to reuse it.
        - Added ByteUtils.getReader(InputStream, CharacterSet) method.
        - Added ByteUtils.getStream(Writer) method. Implementation by
          Kevin Conaway.
        - Added getReader() and a write(Writer) methods on
          Representation class.
        - Exposed the "file" property on the FileRepresentation class.
        - Added two new FreeMarker's TemplateRepresentation constructor
          to allow more ways to provide the template (via a
          representation or directly as a FreeMarker Template object).
        - Added validate() methods on XmlRepresentation to validate an
          XML representation against a given schema.
        - Added a getSource() method on XmlRepresentation that results
          a JAXP Source instance.
        - Added a Template.getVariableNames() method. Suggested by
          Stian Soiland.
        - Added new Dimension.AUTHORIZATION enum entry. Suggested by
          Stian Soiland.
        - Added a Representation.release() to have an uniform way to
          release a representation without forcing a read for example
          or manually closing the socket, the channel, the file, etc.
        - Added a Message.release() method to have an easy way to
          release the message's entity. Suggested by Stian Soiland.
        - Added W3C XML Schema and Relax NG media types.
        - Added new media types for RSS and WADL. Contributed by Avi
          Flax.
        - Added Atom, Relax NG, RSS, RTF, WADL and XSD in the common
          extensions of MetadataService. Contributed by Avi Flax.
        - Simplified the management of MediaType constants. Contributed
          by Stian Soiland.
        - Application is now concrete and has a setRoot() method.
        - Added Component.setDefaultHost() method.
        - Moved the "expirationDate", "modificationDate", "tag", "size"
          properties from Variant to Representation. The old properties
          are only deprecated for now but will be removed in a later
          version.
        - The Resource class now accepts POST requests without any
          entity, or with an empty entity. Suggested by Sean Landis and
          Stian Soiland.
        - Added setters and getters for all the properties of all the
          classes in the API, including the collection properties.
          Clarified the Javadocs for the default collection creations.
          This will greatly facilitate the usage of the API in IoC
          containers like Spring.
        - Renamed "URIResolver" property to "uriResolver" in
          TransformRepresentation.
        - Renamed "*Attribute" properties to "*Parameter" in
          TunnelService.
        - Added "accessRestricted" property to CookieSetting, currently
          mapped to the "httpOnly" Cookie attribute supported by recent
          browsers to prevent XSS attacks. Contributed by Rob Heittman.
        - Added logger-less constructors to Template. Suggested by
          Justin Makeig.
        - Added "available", "modifiable" and "readable" properties to
          the Resource class.
        - Added "rechallengeEnabled" property to Guard (true by
          default) to repeatedly challenge the client upon reception of
          invalid credentials instead of forbidding the access like
          before. This conforms more closely to the HTTP 1.1
          specifications while leaving the door open for the stricter
          behavior. Reported by Stephan Koops.
        - Added the "internalRouter" property to Component to attach
          internal/private Restlets that are accessible via the
          built-in RIAP client (Restlet Internal Access Protocol).
          Suggested by Marc Portier who contributed the test case.
        - Updated the Protocol and LocalReference classes with support
          for the new RIAP scheme.
        - In order to facilitate the implementation of your custom
          Finder, an new createTarget() method taking a Resource class
          in parameter.
        - Added support for the "Content-Disposition" field as a
          "downloadName" property on Representation. Contributed by
          Kevin Conaway. Added a "downloadable" property to activate
          the feature.
        - Added a ResourceException to facilitate the mapping between
          domain exceptions and response status. Suggested by Paul J.
          Lucas and others.
        - Replaced getPreferredRepresentation() and
          getRepresentation(Variant) methods by represent() and
          represent(Variant) methods throwing ResourceExceptions.
        - Added Reference.addQueryParameter() and addSegment() methods.
          Reported by Kevin Conaway.
        - Added Reference(Reference baseRef, Reference uriRef)
          constructor. Suggested by Rob Heittman.
    - NRE and Extension Enhancements
        - Added a new Grizzly based HTTP server connector (full NIO).
          Optmizations and support contributed by Jean-François Arcand.
        - Upgraded Apache MINA to version 1.1.0.
        - There are now default internal HTTP client and server
          connectors exposed in the NRE core. If no other HTTP
          connectors are found in the classpath, those connectors will
          be used. They should perform reasonably under normal
          workloads but won't be as scalable as the NIO based
          connectors such as Grizzly and MINA based ones. You don't
          have anything to do to configure them, just put the
          com.noelios.restlet.jar in your classpath along with the
          Restlet API's JAR. Note that they don't support HTTPS and
          persistent connections. The support for chunked encoding and
          decoding was contributed by Kevin Conaway.
        - All HTTPS server connectors (Grizzly, Jetty and Simple) now
          have two configuration parameters to indicates whether a
          client authentication is wanted or required. Suggested by
          Toby Thain and Chuck Hinson.
        - A request attribute "org.restlet.https.clientCertificates"
          containing the list of SSL session certificates (if available
          and accessible) is now available. Currently, only the Simple
          connector is capable or setting it. Suggested by Toby Thain.
        - Simple connector now initialize a trust manager.
        - Added JAXB extension based on a contribution by Overstock.com
          (via Sean Landis).
        - Added JAXB 2.0 and StAX 1.0 libraries.
        - The ServletConverter now also copy the Servlet's request
          attributes into the Restlet attributes map. Suggested by
          Leigh Klotz.
        - Added automatic call of release() for outgoing
          representations via HTTP connectors. Contribution by Alex
          Milowski.
        - Added SpringApplication, SpringComponent, SpringHost,
          SpringRouter, SpringServer to the Spring extension to
          facilitate the wiring by Spring IoC.
        - If Resource.getRepresentation(Variant) returns 'null', the
          Resource.handleGet() method now returns a NOT_FOUND (404)
          status. Suggested by John D. Mitchell.
        - Added WADL extension with a WadlComponent capable of
          automatically wiring a Restlet component, application and
          resource classes. Suggested by Avi Flax.
        - Added a createComponent() method on ServerServlet to
          facilitate the customization of the component for a Servlet.
        - The Message's getEntityAsDom(), getEntityAsSax() and
          getEntityAsForm() are now caching the result representation
          for easier reuse in a Restlet filters chain. Suggested by Rob
          Heittman.
        - Finder.createResource() method now rethrows the Error
          exceptions thrown by Resource constructors. Suggested by

        - A custom classloader can now be specified when using the CLAP
          URIs. Just set the attribute "org.restlet.clap.classloader"
          on your Request instances with your classloader instance.
          This will be automatically be picked up by the CLAP
          connector. Reported by Alex Milowski.
        - Guard.secrets is now a final ConcurrentMap instead of just a
          Map instance. Suggested by Tim Peierls.
        - Renamed Context's "dispatcher" property into
          "clientDispatcher" to distinguish with the new
          "serverDispatcher" property. The "serverDispatcher" property
          allows the developer to optimize the sending of request to
          applications under the current component/JVM, as if they were
          dispatched by one of the server connectors. Suggested by Rob
          Heittman with feed-back from Marc Portier.
        - Split the Resource class to separate a new
          org.restlet.Handler class exposing the lower-level API, from
          the higher-level API of Resource.
        - Refactored the implementation of dispatchers to derive from a
          base TemplateDispatcher class.
        - The context dispatchers automatically update the identifier
          property of response entities when they are empty, based on
          the request's target URI.
        - Added SpringServer.setParameters(Properties) method.
          Contributed by Kevin Conaway.
        - Response.redirect*(String targetUri) methods now
          automatically resolve relative URIs agains the base reference
          of the Request's resource reference. Suggested by Rob
          Heittman.
    - Misc
        - Removed AsyncWeb connector, to be replaced by a custom MINA
          based one.
        - Removed Jetty 5 connector from the code base. Jetty 6
          connector is stable enough now.
        - Updated projects to Eclipse 3.3. Minor adjustments required.

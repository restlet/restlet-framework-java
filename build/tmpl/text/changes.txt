          Suggested by Paul Davis.
        - The Router.createFinder() method is now public.
        - The Callback abstract class in the GWT module is now an

          getClientDispatcher() method to facilitate extension and 
          support of special cases. 
          Original issue reported by Dave Fogel.
        - Added a client connector supporting ZIP and JAR URIs that
          are based on local archive files.
          Contributed by Remi Dewitte.
        - Enhanced JsonRepresentation based on Tal Liron's contributions.
          Now supports indentation configuration and more manipulation
          and conversion methods.
        - Added RDF extension that aims to support the parsing and 
          writing of RDF representations.

          schemes developed by Microsoft. Suggested by Steve Sfartz.
        - WadlApplication now invokes the findTarget() method on Finder 
          instances instead of the createTarget() one. 
          Suggested by Leigh Klotz.
        - Added Delete, Get, Options, Post and Put annotations
          to the org.restlet.resource package. Based on community 
          feed-back and suggestions by Tim Peierls.

          Suggested by Rhett Sutphin.
        - Added Protocol#ZIP constant.
        - Representation#finalize() method now has a default 
          implementation that calls the release() method.
          Suggested by Remi Dewitte.
        - Updated accept.properties file, removing Firefox 
          customization as version 3.0 has proper 'Accept' header.
        - Added a JaxbRepresentation#setValidationEventHandler method.
        - Added Variant#isCompatible() method.
        - Added an org.restlet.representation.RepresentationInfo class

          the "org.restlet.engine" package, simplifying the packaging.
        - All engine extensions have been moved to "org.restlet.ext"
          packages.
        - The com.noelios.restlet.ext.spring extension has been merged
          with org.restlet.ext.spring.
        - Moved org.restlet.util.DateUtils, ByteUtils and Engine 
          classes to org.restlet.engine.* packages.
    - Enhancements
        - Internal HTTP connector now supports HTTPS connections.
          Contributed by Kevin Conaway.
        - Added a Lucene extension including a Solr client connector
          contributed by Remi Dewitte. Also contains a useful 
          TikaRepresentation to extract metadata from a representation
          using Lucene Tika parsing and analysis library. Suggested by
          Ben Johnson.
        - The Atom Service class now supports getting documents from
          other protocols than HTTP.
        - Updated org.restlet.Component to support validating parsing. 
          Contributed by Raif S. Naffah.

          "schema", "xIncludeAware" and "validating" properties. 
          Contributed by Raif S. Naffah.
    - API changes
        - A response with a 200 (Ok) status should have an entity. Now,
          we make sure that a warning is logged. 
          Reported by Rob Heittman.
        - Removed all code deprecated in the Restlet 1.1 release.
        - Added org.restlet.data.Literal to represent RDF
          literals with an optional datatype. 
        - Added org.restlet.data.Link to represent RDF links (aka 
          triples, statements or relationships).
        - Moved o.r.u.Helper class, used privately by API classes to 
          the o.r.engine package.
        - Added MediaType constants APPLICATION_RDF_TRIG, 
          APPLICATION_RDF_TRIX, APPLICATION_RDF_TURTLE, 
          APPLICATION_SPARQL_RESULTS_XML and
          APPLICATION_SPARQL_RESULTS_JSON for RDF and SPARQL.
        - Added LinkReference and LinkSet classes to support RDF 
          reference manipulation (blank nodes for example) and RDF 
          graphs or models.
        - Added CharacterSet#DEFAULT constant, new constructor for 
          Charset instances and a toCharset() method. Suggested by
          Charles Gay.

        - MediaType constructor now normalizes the main and sub parts.
          If invalid characters are detected, an IllegalArgumentExcept
          is thrown. Spaces are also trimmed and empty parts are 
          converted to '*'. Contributed by Nicolas Rinaudo.
        - Method#setUri() has been deprecated as Method instances 
          shouldn't be modifiable.
        - Language.getSubTags() now returns an unmodifiable list.
        - MediaType.parameters property is now unmodifiable. Initial
          issue reported by Nicolas Rinaudo. 
        - Added static Series#unmodifiableSeries() method.
        - Added DateUtils.format(Date) method which uses HTTP default
          format.
        - Added a new "org.restlet.security" package with a full
          replacement for current Guard mechanism. This is
          an alpha level package not intended for Restlet users yet.
        - Made the SpringBeanRouter implement ApplicationContextAware
          to enable AOP on target resources. Suggested by Daniel Woo.
        - Resource subclasses can now declared variants and match them
          more easily using an automatic detection mechanism based on
          represent*() methods where '*' is a series of extensions. 
          Also added a "detectVariants" property to turn off this
          behavior if necessary.
        - Added a getAllMetadata(String extension) method on the
          MetadataService class. 
        - Deprecated the ClientInfo#addresses property and replaced it
          by a more explicit "forwardedAddresses" property. Also, added
          a new getUpstreamAddress() method. Adjusted the Resolver 
          class to add a new "ciua" variable. Change suggested by 
          John D. Mitchell. Initial patch provided by Remi Dewitte. 	
        - Added ClientInfo#subject property returning a JAAS Subject.
          Can contain several principals and credentials. Deprecated 
          the ChallengeResponse#getPrincipal() method.
        - Added new Conditions.getStatus() method signature for usage
          by the JAX-RS extension. Suggested by Stephan Koops.
    - Misc
        - JAX-RS extension:
            - added class ExendedUriBuilder with "file" extensions for
              content negotiation and an ExtendedUriInfo to get it.
            - Supports per-request-providers now.
            - JaxRsApplication will not clear the MetadataService (as
              before; was required to not use other extensions as given
              in the JAX-RS ApplicationConfig class).
        - The Directory class doesn't override the findTarget() method
          but uses the default Finder mechanism based on the 
          "targetClass" property. Therefore, it is easier to specify a
          subclass of org.restlet.engine.local.DirectoryResource in
          order to customize the default behavior. 
          Suggested by Cliff Binstock.
        - Upgraded db4o to version 7.7.67.
		- Refactored engine support for the StatusService. Removed
		  ApplicationStatusFilter and ComponentStatusFilter.
		- Extracted all internal classes of ByteUtils into the new
		  org.restlet.engine.io package for easier reuse and 
		  maintenance.
		- Clarified Javadocs in Reference#getPath() methods.
        - Fixed potential NPE in Reference#decode() method.
        - Clarified Javadocs in FileRepresentation and methods 
          Representation#getDownloadName(), setDownloadName() in order
          to explain that setDownloadable(true) must be called first.
          Issue reported by Kevin Conaway.
        - The internal HTTP client doesn't send absolute request URIs
          anymore. It now sends them as relative URIs according to the
          HTTP 1.1 specification. Reported by Jonas Maturana Larsen.
        - Upgraded Apache Commons IO to version 1.4.
        - The ServerServlet now sets the HTTP headers after the status
          to prevent issues with Tomcat 5.0 and "Content-Length: 0" 
          headers sending the response immediately. 
          Reported by Eirik Bjorsnos. 
		- The internal HTTP client no longer forces the user agent name
		  if one has already been specified by the user. Contributed by
		  Kevin Conaway.

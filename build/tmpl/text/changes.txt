    - Misc
      - Removed the Tanuki's Java Service Wrapper library.

      - Exceptions annotated with @Status are now automatically serialized
        using ConverterService on both client-side and server-side.
        Client-side resource proxy automatically re-throw the de-serialized
        exception back to the API call invoker. Note that when the application
        is not in debugging mode, the stacktrace is cleared before
        serialization and a warning is triggered if a cause is available in
        the exception.

        Throwable Java classes between HTTP statuses and error response entities.
        NOTE: implementation is in progress.

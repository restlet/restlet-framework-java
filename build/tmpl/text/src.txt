Source files
============


In this directory you will find the source files for the Restlet project, 
organized by plugins. The main purpose is to let you link the sources to
the Restlet plugins in your preferred IDE in order to enable debugging 
inside the Restlet code.

If you want to rebuild the whole project by yourself, you need to follow
the instructions available on the Restlet Developers Site:
http://wiki.restlet.org/developers/170-restlet.html

Best regards,
The Restlet Team

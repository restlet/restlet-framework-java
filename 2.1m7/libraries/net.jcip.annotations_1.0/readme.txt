"Quercus presents a new mixed Java/PHP approach to web applications and 
services where Java and PHP tightly integrate with each other. PHP 
applications can choose to use Java libraries and technologies like JMS, 
EJB, SOA frameworks, Hibernate, and Spring. This revolutionary capability 
is made possible because 
1) PHP code is interpreted/compiled into Java and 
2) Quercus and its libraries are written entirely in Java. 

This architecture allows PHP applications and Java libraries to talk 
directly with one another at the program level. To facilitate this new 
Java/PHP architecture, Quercus provides and API and interface to expose 
Java libraries to PHP."

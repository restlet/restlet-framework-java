 * Description of data contained in a resource representation.<br/><br/> "A representation consists of data,
 * metadata describing the data, and, on occasion, metadata to describe the metadata (usually for the purpose
 * of verifying message integrity). Metadata is in the form of name-value pairs, where the name corresponds to
 * a standard that defines the value's structure and semantics. Response messages may include both
 * representation metadata and resource metadata: information about the resource that is not specific to the
 * supplied representation." Roy T. Fielding

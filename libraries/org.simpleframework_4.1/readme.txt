Simple Framework
----------------

"The goal of Simple is to bring the power of simplicity to the world of server 
side Java. The primary focus of the project is to provide a truly embeddable 
Java based HTTP engine capable of handling enormous loads. It also provides 
a component based framework for extendability, which is used to facilitate 
loadable services similar to Java Servlets. Simple has consistently out 
performed both commercial and open source Java Servlet engines and has a fully 
comprehensive API that is as usable for experienced Java developers as it is 
for beginners. Best of all, Simple is completely free, and is released under 
the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License, LGPL, which ensures its 
availability for use by open source and proprietary developers alike."

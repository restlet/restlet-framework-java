"Apache Mime4j provides a parser, MimeStreamParser, for e-mail message 
streams in plain rfc822 and MIME format. The parser uses a callback 
mechanism to report parsing events such as the start of an entity 
header, the start of a body, etc. If you are familiar with the SAX 
XML parser interface you should have no problem getting started with 
mime4j. "

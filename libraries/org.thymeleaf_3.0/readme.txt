Thymeleaf
---------

"Thymeleaf is a Java library. It is an XML / XHTML / HTML5 template engine 
(extensible to other formats) that can work both in web and non-web environments. 
It is better suited for serving XHTML/HTML5 at the view layer of web 
applications, but it can process any XML file even in offline environments. "

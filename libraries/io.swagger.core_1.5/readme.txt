Swagger - Document your API with style
--------------------------------------

"Swagger is a specification and complete framework implementation for
describing, producing, consuming, and visualizing RESTful web services.
The overarching goal of Swagger is to enable client and documentation systems
to update at the same pace as the server. The documentation of methods,
parameters and models are tightly integrated into the server code,
allowing APIs to always stay in sync."

Apache HTTP Components Core
---------------------------

"HttpCore is a set of low level HTTP transport components that can 
be used to build custom client and server side HTTP services with a 
minimal footprint. HttpCore supports two I/O models: blocking I/O 
model based on the classic Java I/O and non-blocking, event driven 
I/O model based on Java NIO."

Netty - Asynchronous event-driven network application framework
---------------------------------------------------------------

"Netty is a NIO client server framework which enables quick and
easy development of network applications such as protocol 
servers and clients. It greatly simplifies and streamlines 
network programming such as TCP and UDP socket server.

'Quick and easy' doesn't mean that a resulting application will 
suffer from a maintainability or a performance issue. Netty has 
been designed carefully with the experiences earned from the 
implementation of a lot of protocols such as FTP, SMTP, HTTP, 
and various binary and text-based legacy protocols. As a 
result, Netty has succeeded to find a way to achieve ease of 
development, performance, stability, and flexibility without a 
compromise."

Google Web Toolkit
------------------

"Google Web Toolkit (GWT) is an open source Java software development 
framework that makes writing AJAX applications like Google Maps and 
Gmail easy for developers who don't speak browser quirks as a second 
language. Writing dynamic web applications today is a tedious and 
error-prone process; you spend 90% of your time working around subtle
incompatibilities between web browsers and platforms, and 
JavaScript's lack of modularity makes sharing, testing, and reusing 
AJAX components difficult and fragile."

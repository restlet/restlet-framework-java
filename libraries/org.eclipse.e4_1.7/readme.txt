Eclipse E4 
-----------

"The mission of the e4 project is to build a next generation platform for 
pervasive, component-based applications and tools.

The Eclipse platform was first targeted at building an extensible IDE 
component framework. It has since grown to include a Rich Client Platform, 
enabling whole new categories of scenarios and domains. As the software 
landscape changes, so must the Eclipse platform in order to remain relevant 
and vibrant. These trend lines point to web technologies, new user interface 
metaphors, and distributed infrastructure. Now is the time to rethink elements 
of the platform so that Eclipse may remain at the forefront of application 
development. "

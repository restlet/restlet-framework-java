JSON - JavaScript Object Notation
---------------------------------

"JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read 
and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a 
subset of the JavaScript Programming Language, Standard ECMA-262 
3rd Edition - December 1999. JSON is a text format that is completely language 
independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the 
C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, 
and many others. These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange language."

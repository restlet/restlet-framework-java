Grizzly NIO framework
---------------------

"Writing scalable server applications in the Java programming language has 
always been difficult. Before the advent of the Java New I/O API (NIO), 
thread management issues made it impossible for a server to scale to 
thousands of users. The Grizzly framework has been designed to help 
developers to take advantage of the Java NIO API. Originally developed 
under the GlassFish umbrella, the framework is now available as a 
standalone project. Grizzly goals is to help developers to build scalable 
and robust servers using NIO."

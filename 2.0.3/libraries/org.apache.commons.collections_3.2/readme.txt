Apache Commons Collections
--------------------------

"The Java Collections Framework was a major addition in JDK 1.2. It added many 
powerful data structures that accelerate development of most significant Java 
applications. Since that time it has become the recognised standard for 
collection handling in Java.

Commons-Collections seek to build upon the JDK classes by providing new 
interfaces, implementations and utilities."

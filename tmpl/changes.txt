[Bugs fixed]
 - Fixed issue with error status preventing the setting of response headers with Servlet containers like Tomcat. Report and solution by Evan DiBiase.
 - Completed support for content streaming in the HTTP client connector extension. Issue reported by Mikkel Jensen.
 - Fixed bug in ParameterList.getFirstValue(String, boolean) ignoring the "ignoreCase" parameter.
 - Fixed issue with ServerServlet preventing the returning of an output representation with an error status code. Reported by Sean Landis.
  
[API breaking changes]
 - Moved hasInput() method from org.restlet.connector.Client to Call.isInputAvailable().
 - Renamed Representation.isContentAvailable() to isAvailable() and isContentTransient() to isTransient().
 - Application now only requires a Context and not a Container.
 - WrapperRestlet.getWrappedRestlet() is now protected instead of public, only subclasses should have access to the wrapped Restlet.
 - Merged Client and GenericClient into a single Client class.
 - Moved com.noelios.restlet.connector into hidden com.noelios.restlet.impl.connector package.
 - Moved internal utilities from com.noelios.restlet.util into hidden com.noelios.restlet.impl.util package.
 - Moved com.noelios.restlet.spi into hidden com.noelios.restlet.impl package.
 - Moved org.restlet.component.ContainerContext to com.noelios.restlet.impl.component.ContainerContext.
 - Renamed Server."next" property into "target". "Next" was assuming that a previous Restlet existed, which is false for Server connectors.
 - Removed static Restlet.handle(Call call, Restlet target) method. Now Restlet automatically start themselves on first call.
 - Moved com.noelios.restlet.util.WrapperMap into org.restlet.util.
 - Removed Restlet.compareTo() method. No apparent usage.
 - Renamed Reference.getProtocol() into getSchemeProtocol().
 - Connector and Component no longer derive from Restlet, it was allowing some code reuse but also created some confusion between those core concepts.
 - Scorer now derives from Filter to improve factorization.
 - Renamed Handler into Finder (hopefully more explicit as UniformInterface has a "handle" method).
 - Renamed DirectoryHandler* classes into DirectoryFinder*.
 - Added Context.getClient() returning a ClientInterface for a specific protocol.
 - Removed get/post/put/delete methods on Context as getClient() or handle() are preferred.
 - Added a post() method on Resource returning an instance of the new org.restlet.data.Result class as well as put() and delete().
 - Renamed Chainer.findNext(Call) into getNext(Call). Chainer is now abstract.
 - Scorer is now abstract to force implementation of the score() method.
 - Renamed "name" property into "agent" for ClientData and ServerData.
 - Added "name" (for domain name) and "port" properties to ServerData, matching HTTP's "Host" header.
 - Refactored HttpCall and related classes to better handle and preserve the "Host" header information.
 - Renamed CallModel variable "clientName" into "client.agent" and "serverName" into "server.agent", also
   "serverAddress" into "server.address" and "clientAddress" into "client.address".
 - Removed Context.getClient(protocol) method, now Context directly implements ClientInterface.
  
[Other changes] 
 - Updated Jetty 6 extension to final 6.0 release.
 - Added Resource.setVariants() and setIdentifiers() methods. Can be easier than doing a getVariants().clear() then a getVariants().addAll(newList). 
   Suggested by Chris Winters.
 - org.restlet.ReferenceList now derives from WrapperList<Reference> to factorize code and to clarify (in Javadocs) which extra methods are provided.
 - Improved Javadocs for the org.restlet.Handler class to explain what is the default behavior of each handle*() method. 
 - Refactored ServerServlet to cleanly support call converters via a HttpServer instance working as an intermediary between the Servlet and the target Restlet.
 - Refactored all HTTP client and server classes to work with the new call converter mechanism.
 - Renamed AbstractHttpServer to HttpServer, AbstractHttpServerCall to HttpServerCall and AbstractHttpClientCall to HttpClientCall.
 - Merged HttpCall interface and DefaultHttpCall class into single HttpCall class.
 - Added com.noelios.restlet.connector.HttpServerConverter as the base call converter (from HTTP calls to uniform REST calls).
 - Refactored the HttpUrlConnection-based HTTP client to extract a generic HttpClientConverter and added a base HttpClient class.
 - Added new constructors to Client and Server to be match Connector's constructors.
 - Added support of server HTTP headers in uniform Call instance. The request headers are available in call.getAttributes().get("org.restlet.http.
   requestHeaders") as an instance of ParameterList. Additional response headers can also be added by setting a "org.restlet.http.responseHeaders" 
   attribute. Note that only non-standard HTTP headers are allowed to be added to prevent conflicts with the connector's behavior.
 - Added support of client HTTP headers in uniform Call instance. The response headers are available in call.getAttributes().get("org.restlet.http.
   responseHeaders") as an instance of ParameterList. Additional request headers can also be added by setting a "org.restlet.http.requestHeaders" 
   attribute. Note that only non-standard HTTP headers are allowed to be added to prevent conflicts with the connector's behavior.
 - Added sample application illustrating the access raw HTTP headers. Used suggestion from John D. Mitchell.
 - Added static valueOf() methods to ChallengeScheme, CharacterSet, Encoding, Language, MediaType, Method, Protocol and Status. Sometimes renamed existing create() method. Suggested by Piyush Purang.
 - Added new Context constructor taking just a logger name.
 - Clarified the Javadocs of root classes in org.restlet.
 - Added more constructors to Chainer, Filter and Handler.
 - Readded UniformInterface and added ClientInterface.
 - Component and Connector now implement UniformInterface. Reenabled internal optimizations.
 - Added a Call.setOutput(String, MediaType) method facilitating the setting of string-based output representations.
 - Fully updated the FAQ.
 - Updated pictures in the tutorial to reflect the latest API changes (Application, hierarchy changes, etc.).
 - Form handling code don't throw IO exceptions anymore for Call.getInputAsForm() and Reference.getQueryAsForm(). Issue reported by Piyush Purang.
 - Added modification support (PUT and DELETE) to DirectoryFinder. Suggested by Don Dwoske and John D. Mitchell. Implementation contributed by Thierry Boileau.
 - Added "protocol" property on Call.
 - Added FTP constant to Protocol.
 - Improved detection of default ports in Reference.toString() static methods. Added new toString() variant.
 - HTTP client connectors now set the "Host" header manually when proper information is found via Call.getServer()."name" and "port".
 - Refactored the parsing/construction of the target resource reference to handle both relative and absolute URIs.
 - Improved robustness of Reference when handling relative URIs.
 - Added a "javadoc-hide" property to "build.properties" to hide the Javadocs of implementation packages (true by default).
 - Added shortcut attach/detach methods to Router, equivalent to getScorers().add()/removeAll().
 - Method Filter.getNext(Call) is now final to prevent overriding. If needed, use Chainer as base class.
 - Added ScorerList.removeAll(UniformInterface) method to remove all scorers pointing to a given handler.
 - Added Protocol.ALL constant as a protocol wildcard.

1.0 beta 18 (2006-08-19)
[Bugs fixed]
 - Status descriptions are now sent back to Jetty 6 for error statuses. Reported by AJ Barnes.
 - The DirectoryHandler was listing the directories twice to do the content negotiation, slowing down the process. 
 - The content negotiation was not properly handling the situation where no language and media type preferences are defined. Reported by Thierry Boileau.
 - Fixed potential NPE in DefaultClient and RedirectTestCase when no connector found.
 - Fixed bug in NRE's factory which prevented the detection of HTTPS connectors. Now all HTTPS connectors work fully (Simple, Jetty5 and Jetty6).
 - Fixed bug in DirectoryHandler preventing the return of a directory listing if an index file name was set but not found. Reported by Thierry Boileau.
 - Added option to turn off content negotiation on DirectoryHandler which was causing some issues with online Javadocs. The content negotiation is now
   off by default. Reported by Tiago Silveira.
 - Fixed caching conflicts with content negotiation. Now ETags are properly considered. Reported by Chris Winters.
 - Fixed potential NPE in the DateUtils comparison methods. Reported by Chris Winters.
 - Reworked all equals() methods in the data package to accept Object as parameter. 
 - Fixed bug in MediaType.includes() and added a JUnit test case for MediaType comparison. Report and patch by Chris Winters.
 - Fixed bug in fluent builders prevent the proper usage of routers in routing mode.
 
[API breaking changes]
 - Removed get/setTimeout() methods from the Client interface and related classes. Also, removed the configureSsl() method from the Server interface.
 	We will now use connectors'parameters instead. Suggested by John D. Mitchell.
 - NRE's HttpClient (based on HttpUrlConnection) now used these parameters: "chunkLength", "followRedirects", "allowUserInteraction", "useCaches"
   "connectTimeout" and "readTimeout".
 - NRE's HttpClient no longers sets the JDK's system property "http.keepalive" to "false". This could conflict with other classes using HttpUrlConnection.
 - Jetty 5.1 connector now supports parameters: "minThreads", "maxThreads", "lowResourcePersistTimeMs", "maxIdleTimeMs" for the HTTP server and
   "keystorePath", "keystorePassword", "keyPassword" for the HTTPS one.
 - Simple 3.1 connector now supports parameters: "defaultThreads", "waitTimeMs" for the HTTP server and "keystorePath", "keystorePassword",
   "keyPassword" for the HTTPS one.
 - Moved Jetty5 to com.noelios.ext.jetty5 package so that Javadocs of both versions can be displayed.
 - The "X-Forwarded-For" header is not used anymore by default to get all client addresses, including intermediary proxies. However, there is now a 
   standard way to enable this feature: by setting the "useForwardedForHeader" parameter to "true" for the HTTP server connector used. Be aware of the
   potential security effects of using this header if you don't control all the intermediary proxies as the header could be faked otherwise. This change
   was suggested by John D. Mitchell.
 - Removed unused org.restlet.connector.LocalClient connector.
 - Moved content of com.noelios.restlet.impl to com.noelios.restlet, com.noelios.restlet.connector and com.noelios.restlet.data
 - Renamed Call's "outputRef" property back to "redirectRef" as we now have Representation's "identifier" property to get the location of the call's output.
 - Factorized all Call's client data into ClientData class (was PreferenceData). 
 - Factorized all Call's server data into a new ServerData class.
 - Renamed Call.contextRef into Call.baseRef and Call.relativePath into Call.relativePart. Added Call.getRelativeRef returning a real relative reference.
 - org.restlet.Call is now a class instead of an interface. Removed DefaultCall classes.
 - Removed "requestHeader" and "responseHeader" variables from CallModel. Not accessible anymore at this point from an uniform Call.
 - Renamed static Reference.toUri() method into Reference.toString() for consistency with existing Reference.toString() methods (non-static).
 - Renamed Call.setBestOutput() into Call.setOutput() and adjusted the Javadocs to explain behavior (set best output for the given resource).
 - Removed empty and unused interfaces Gateway, OriginServer, Proxy, UserAgent, Cache, Resolver, Tunnel, ControlData, Data. Suggested by Piyush Purang.
 - Refactored CharacterSet, CharacterSets and DefaultCharacterSet into a single CharacterSet class.
 - Refactored Encoding, Encodings and DefaultEncoding into a single Encoding class. 
 - Refactored ChallengeScheme, ChallengeSchemes and DefaultChallengeScheme into a single ChallengeScheme class. 
 - Refactored Language, Languages and DefaultLanguage into a single Language class. 
 - Refactored MediaType, MediaTypes and DefaultMediaType into a single MediaType class. 
 - Refactored Method, Methods and DefaultMethod into a single Method class. 
 - Refactored Protocol, Protocols and DefaultProtocol into a single Protocol class. 
 - Refactored Status, Statuses and DefaultStatus into a single Status class. 
 - Fixed the remaining inconsistent usages of ParameterList. Removed MediaType.getParametersValue(). 
   Now getParameters() methods always instantiate a new list of none was existing before.
 - Separated HTTP constants (header names and status codes) into a separate HttpConstants class.
 - Added an org.restlet.component.Application class to hold a portable Restlet Application.
 - Added org.restlet.Context and a specialized ContainerContext subclass. This allow container to provide contextual services to Restlet, without giving
   a direct access to the container itself or to its connectors.
 - Following the advices of API design gurus Eamonn McManus and Joshua Bloch), I've refactored the whole API in several ways:
    - Set most of the member variables to "private" instead of "protected" for better encapsulation and evolving capabilities
    - Removed most interfaces which and too fragile and little useful without a default/abstract implementation. 
 - Removed RestletServer and RestletContainer, replaced by Container and Application. A container manages a set of applications.
 - Separated the Handler concept into a Chainer (similar signature) and a Handler (new method specific to find the target resource). Handler now directly
   derives from Restlet. The goal is to provide a cleaner separation of roles.
 - The Resource interface doesn't derive anymore from Restlet. The responsability of the control and handling of incoming calls is moved to the repurposed
   Handler class.
 - Replaced ServerMap and ClientMap by ServerList and ClientList to fit with the new Container and Application classes. 
 - Renamed DefaultClient and DefaultServer to GenericClient and GenericServer to better reflect the purpose of the classes and the concept of call
   dispatcher based on the scheme instead of the connector name.  
 - Removed addition of custom headers from Call.connectorCall for JavaMailClient and HttpClient. Will now require the usage of Converters.
 - Fully refactored the context data of Call. Added a new org.restlet.data.ContextData class containing all data potentially varying with the current
   Restlet handling the call. For example Call.getResourcePath() is now Call.getContext().getRelativePath(), Call.setContextPath() is now Call.getContext().
   setBaseRef(), etc.
 - Replaced the CharacterSetPref, EncodingPref, LanguagePref and MediaTypePref by a generic Preference<Metadata> class.
 - Replaced Router.Mode enumeration by static constants on Router. Simplifies the Javadocs display and works well enough.
 - Moved org.restlet.Factory into a hidden org.restlet.spi.Factory package. Same thing for the NRE's Factory.
 - Replaced HostRouter.Mode enumeration by constants on HostRouter.
 - Moved WrapperMap to NRE util package as it's not used anymore in the API.
 - ScorerList now derives from WrapperList like similar classes (ClientList, ParameterList, etc.).
 - Renamed RedirectHandler to RedirectRestlet as it is not taking advantage of the features of a Handler.
 - Refactored the Servlet connector to make it work with the new notion of Restlet's context.
 - Added put() and delete() methods on Resource interface and related classes.
 - Renamed ContextClient into LocalClient to remove ambiguity with concept of Restlet's context.
 - Handler now has a default implementation of the handlePut() and handleDelete() methods.
 - Renamed ClientData.get*Prefs() methods into getAccepted*() to be more inline with HTTP terminology.
 - Refactored and improved robustness of the ServerServlet adapter. Now you have access to the ServletContext's logger and resources via the standard
   Restlet.getContext() methods.
 - Renamed HostRouter.ROUTING and FILTERING to USAGE_ROUTING and USAGE_FILTERING.
 - Renamed Router.mode to Router.routingMode.
 
[Other changes] 
 - Separated the HTTP client connector (based on JDK's HttpUrlConnection) previously integrated to the NRE core. This will allow future alternative
   implementations like based on Apache HTTP Client or Apache MINA NIO framework. Please ensure that the new extension (com.noelios.restlet.ext.net) is
   added to your classpath when the application is making HTTP client calls.
 - Added ParameterList.getFirstValue() methods taking and additional "defaultValue" parameter.
 - Parameterized all connectors, including the LocalClient.
 - Added HTTPS connector for Jetty 6.0
 - Updated Jetty 6 to RC1.
 - The Jetty 6 extension now appears in the Javadocs due to the package renaming of the Jetty 5 extension.
 - Updated documentation, especially for the distribution. Suggested by Dave Pawson.
 - Added more control on Simple HTTPS connector, see list of parameters.
 - Updated AsyncWeb to version 0.8.2.
 - The number of worker threads can now be configured for AsyncWeb.
 - Refactored the names in the NRE's impl package, uses Abstract prefix for abstract classes and Default prefix for other ones implementing Restlet API.
 - The ServerServlet connector now copies all Servlet initialization parameters (from the Web Application then from the Web Container) into the connector
   parameters list. This allows the settings of the parameters related to HTTP server connectors in all cases (standalone or embedded).
 - ContextClient now uses parameters for its configuration (default encoding, language, mediatype, etc.).
 - Some unit test were catching exceptions, preventing JUnit from failing the tests.
 - Added a Resource.setIdentifier() method taking a URI as a String.
 - Now the "Content-Location" is supported, for both the HTTP client and server connectors. The corresponding property is available via the 
   call.getOutput().get/setIdentifier() method.
 - Added a default implementation for the HEAD method in AbstractResource and AbstractHttpServer. Suggested by Thierry Boileau.
 - Now, all calls' resource references are automatically normalized to ensure a consistent handling. Reported by Thierry Boileau.
 - Added Eclipse code formatter and template styles used to SVN.
 - Added DirectoryHandlerBuilder to allow the setting of the contentNegotiation flag.
 - Added SVG media type constant to MediaTypes. Also part of the common extesions (*.svg) of ContextClient.
 - Improved the default directory listing template to look more like Apache style of listing. Added the ".." link when possible, etc.
 - Added Reference.getParentRef() method.
 - Added Tag.ALL constant, equivalent to the special "*" value in HTTP.
 
1.0 beta 17 (2006-07-19)
[Bugs fixed]
 - Fixed regression in Jetty 6.0 connector which prevented the handling of requests. 
 - When building its pattern, the HostRouter now adds case insensitive flags for scheme names and domain names, strictly following the URI specification. 
   Bug reported by Jim.
 - Fixed bugs in Reference.setHostName().
 - Fixed potential NPE in com.noelios.restlet.ext.fileupload.RepresentationContext. Reported by Mikkel Jensen.
 - Fixed potential NPE exceptions in the equals() methods of many metadata classes. Was causing a bug on http://www.noelios.com with English only browsers.
   Bug reported by Guillaume Laforge (Groovy).
 - For some unknown reason we were lower casing the type name in DefaultMediaType's constructor. This causes issues with FileUpload. 
   Reported by Mikkel Jensen.
 - Fixed potential NPE in Reference.getTargetRef(). Reported by Thierry Boileau.
 - Fixed issue in ServletCall which was not setting the reason phrase for error statuses. Reported by Bill Morone.

[API breaking changes]
 - Renamed Filter.attach/detach to get/setTarget. Users won't assume that multiple targets can be attached, also the target can be looked up.
 - Removed nextHandle() method from Handler and AbstractHandler. Didn't bring much value.
 - Renamed RestletContainer.attach/detach into get/setRoot. 
 - Renamed Router.getOptions() to getScorers() and changed the result type from List<Scorer> to ScorerList.
 - Removed Router.attach() methods and added equivalent add() methods to ScorerList.
 - Removed Router.detach() method. Use the getOptions().remove() methods instead.
 - Moved some routing logic from DefaultRouter to ScorerList, see new getFirst(), getLast(), getBest(), getNext() and getRandom() methods.
 - Renamed RouterMode.*_MATCH to RouterMode.* and ROUND_ROBIN to NEXT. Improved Javadocs.
 - Moved enumeration org.restlet.RouterMode into Router.Mode.
 - Refactorized usage of modifiable lists and map for more consistency. Suggested by Lars Heuer.
    - Added org.restlet.data.WrapperList and WrapperMap classes.
    - Added org.restlet.connector.ClientMap and ServerMap classes. 
    - Moved Component.addClient() and addServer() methods to ClientMap.put() and ServerMap.put().
    - Updated tutorial examples to follow new syntax.
    - ParameterList now extends WrapperList to factorize wrapping logic.
    - RestletServer now uses a list of RestletContainer instead of a map. Removed unecessary add() methods.

[Other changes] 
 - Fully reorganized the SVN code base to separate the packages and third-party into a set of Eclipse plugin projects with inter-dependencies.
 - Improved the packaging in the distribution so that each module/extension JAR is also an Eclipse plugin. Third-party libraries are also available
   as plugins directories. All the content of the "lib/" directory can be dropped in an Eclipse "plugins/" directory for direct usage in the IDE.
 - Added a "dependency.txt" file to list the main dependencies between the various plugins (external libraries and internal modules).
 - Added new RoadMap document at http://www.restlet.org/roadmap
 - Added new FAQ entry on "What are the underlying concepts?" and reorganized the questions a little.
 - Updated FreeMarker to version 2.3.8.
 - Updated Simple framework to version 3.1.3.
 - Updated Jetty 6 to version 6.0.0 RC0.
 - Updated JUnit to version 4.1.
 - Updated JavaMail to version 1.4.
 - Updated SLF4J to version 1.0.2.
 - Ensured that Reference normalization, scheme name setting and host name setting use lower case according to URI specification.
 - Added Preference.toString() implementation based on patch submitted by Chris Winters.
 - Added org.restlet.data.ScorerList implementing List<Scorer>.
 - Changed Preference.parameters type from List<Parameter> to ParameterList and adjusted related classes.
 - Added DefaultRouter.customFind() method as an easy hook for the RouteMode.CUSTOM routing mode.
 - Factorized the handling of IO exception in various HTTP server connectors into the base com.noelios.restlet.impl.HttpServer class.
 	Now, when an IO exception, a one line log entry is added at the WARNING level, and the full stack trace is added at the INFO level.
 	This is important to prevent excessive log entries for the Simple connector when the connection is closed by the client (Broken Pipe).
 - Improved the logging of PatternScorer's logic. Adjust your logging properties to see the traces (FINE and FINER levels).
 - Added log traces in CallImpl when a contextPath/Ref is specified before any resourcePath/Ref was specified. Reported by Thierry Boileau.

1.0 beta 16 (2006-06-30)
 - Renamed attachPath() to attachRouter() in RouterBuilder.
 - Updated all tutorial code snippets (some were slightly outdated)
 - Removed dependency of API on NRE in ReferenceList and RestletContainer.
 - Fixed bug in TunnelFilter (see issue 68). Reported by A.J. Barnes.
 - Restructured code source to split the "source/main" directory into "source/api" and "source/core".
 - Split NRE Javadocs into NRE Core Javadocs and NRE Extensions Javadocs.

1.0 beta 15 (2006-06-26)
 - Updated Jetty 6 to version beta 17.
 - Updated Apache FileUpload extension to version 1.1.1.
 - Fixed encoding name in JdbcClient sample XML document. Reported by Thierry Boileau.
 - Added new FileRepresentation constructor accepting a File instance.
 - Improved ByteUtils.write() methods for streams by automatically buffering output streams if necessary.
 - Removed the unecessary buffering of the input stream in ByteUtils.write(). We don't use the mark and set features.
 - Fixed AbstractRestlet which was not reporting the proper error when non standard Method instances were called but not handled.
 - Added CONTEXT and FILE protocols to Protocols enumeration.
 - Added com.noelios.restlet.data.FileReference.
 - Added org.restlet.data.ReferenceList to handle list of references, supporting the "text/uri-list" representations.
 - Renamed com.noelios.restlet.impl.HttpServerCallImpl to HttpServerCall.
 - Renamed "initParameters" into "properties" for Component interface and related classes.
 - Refactored the methods allowing the attachment of connectors in Component interface and related classes.
 - Removed "name" property from Connector and Component interfaces and related classes.
 - Added modifiable "properties" map to the Connector interface.
 - Added ContextClient implementing a client connector for the CONTEXT and FILE protocols, allowing REST access to contextual resources.
 - Moved StringUtils.normalizePath() method to FileReference.
 - Added JarReference supporting the JAR URIs defined by JDK's JarUrlConnection.
 - Added ContextReference supporting the custom context URIs. Those URIs allow the loading of representation from various contextual locations
   like the current class's classloader, the system's classloader, the Web application's context and the current thread's classloader.
 - Component.callClient(name, call) now recursively tries to find the closest match for the connector name by navigating in the hierarchy 
   of owner components.
 - Fixed bug in ServerServlet in order to auto-start the target Restlet. Problem identified by Bill Morone.
 - Added ServletContextClient to server as a specialized ContextClient when the ServerServlet server connector is used.
 - Added log traces with the Router/PatternScorer logic with info on URI matching and context updating. 
   Enable the log level FINE and FINER to see them in your log file. See JDK's logging mechanism for details. Reported by Bill Morone.
 - Added HttpUrlConnectionCall, subclass of the (now) generic HttpClientCall, that is based on JDK's HttpUrlConnection.
 - Changed the default value inserted by the RedirectRestlet when a URI variable is not found: was "null" and now is an empty string.
 - Changed the repeating variable delimiter in CallModel from "[" and "]" to "(" and ")" to prevent conflicts with the default instruction delimiter
   characters in StringTemplate. Reported by John D. Mitchell.
 - Added the possibility to add a local test for variable insertions: ${variableName?exists} in order to test the existence of the variable first.
   This is equivalent to #[if variableName]${variableName}#[end] but obviously shorter. Without this local test, the default model value will be inserted
   which may be "null" or some unfriendly string. Added related unit tests.
 - Added HTTP server connector based on AsyncWeb 0.8 which is based on Apache Mina 0.8. Contributed by Lars Heuer. Suggested by John D. Mitchell.
 - Removed ClientCall interface and refactored the Client interface and related classes that were too HTTP oriented. 
 - Removed the ServerCall interface and moved the contract/logic into a new com.noelios.restlet.impl.HttpServer. It was to HTTP oriented.
   Refactored all Server related classes to adjust to the change. Provided a useful static handle(HttpServerCall, Restlet) method for classes that 
   can't subclass HttpServer directly (Jetty 6 server and Servlet server).
 - Rewrote the tutorial part 11 (Routers and hierarchical URIs) to follow the best practice of not subclassing DefaultRouter. This is also more consistent 
   with the part 12 using the fluent builders. Suggested by Bill Morone.
 - Removed the FileRestlet which doesn't bring significant lot of value now that we have a flexible DirectoryRestlet and ContextResource.
 - Renamed FileResource into ContextResource because it can now expose representation with all context authorities (file, class loaders, webapp context).
 - Refactored all connector to be stricter with the concept of supported protocol: it now means that the connector instance simultaneously supports all
   the protocols at the same time. When serveral protocols could be supported by a connector but in separate instances, a refactoring was done to create
   a subclass for each protocol.
 - The convention saying that each connector must provide a static getProtocols() method was replaced by a non-static getProtocols() method returning 
   the list of protocol that can be simultaneously supported by the same instance. 
 - For simplication purpose, the ServerServlet doesn't implements the Server interface anymore. It's still a pseudo-connector.
 - ComponentBuilder.setParameter() method was changed to addParameter() allowing repeating parameters.
 - Components and Connectors now have a getParameters() method that exposes a modifiable list of parameters (ParameterList instance).
 - Moved ContextResource to "impl" package
 - Added "readOnly" property to DirectoryRestlet to enable modifications from the client. By default, "readOnly" is set to true. Suggested by
 	Don Dwoske and John D. Mitchell.
 - Refactored Resource interface to extend both Data and Restlet interfaces and moved it to the org.restlet.data package according to the REST classification.
 - Renamed Resource.getVariantsMetadata() to getVariants() for simplification purpose.
 - Added "identifier" and "identifiers" properties to the Resource interface (Reference instances), for the official and alias URIs.
 - Renamed "Chainlet" to "Filter" for all related classes, method names, references, etc. 
 - Detailled the Filter interface with three methods: beforeHandle(), doHandle() and afterHandle() to facilitate 
   creation of concrete filters for pre- and post-filtering.
 - Removed all templatization of Restlet related classes which caused too many warning now that both Resource and
   Representation are also implementing the Restlet interface and deriving from AbstractRestlet.
 - Added org.restlet.Scorer, org.restlet.AbstractScorer and com.noelios.restlet.impl.PatternScorer to formalize
   the attachment of Restlets to Routers. 
 - Renamed "refirectionRef" to "outputRef" in Call, as this can be used for more than just redirection (cf HTTP)
 - Removed all attach() method that were accepting a Restlet class instead of a simple instance. The introduction
   of Handlers reduces the need for them and they seemed to confuse people. Impact of Router, Filter and Restlet
   Container interfaces and related classes (builders, etc.).
 - Merged RepresentationMetadata with the parent Representation and introduced a cleaner contract for getting the
   metadata information without loading in memory the actual representation's content. In particular, the 
   "contentTransient" and "contentAvailable" properties were added to Representation and supported all over the place.
 - Added or improved the wrapper classes: WrapperRestlet, WrapperResource, WrapperRepresentation.
 - Improved the Router (ex-Maplet) interface, adding the "mode" (see RouterMode enum), "requiredScore" to consider
   a routing option as a match, "maxAttempts" for dynamic routing, "retryDelay" between two attempts. Exposed a 
   modifiable list of routing options (Scorer).
 - Added the Handler interface and related classes as a parent interface for Router, Scorer and Filter interfaces.
 - Added RouterMode enumeration containing available routing modes (round robin, first match, last match, best
   match, random and custom). Those modes (except "custom") are directly supported by the DefaultRouter.
 - Reviewed and improved all the NRE representation to better support character encodings (StringRepresentation),
   serializable objects (ObjectRepresentation). Moved common logic to ByteUtils.
 - Renamed DirectoryRestlet into DirectoryHandler. No impact for those using the fluent builders.
 - A default ContextClient is automatically added to each RestletContainer created.
 - Removed the "contextMatches" property from Call interface and related classes. This was not that much useful nor working as expected.

1.0 beta 14 (2006-06-02)
 - Adjusted build.properties so that default values work directly.
 - Refactored the usage of parameter lists by using a new ParameterList (implementing List<Parameter>) and adding helper methods.
 - Form now derives from ParameterList.
 - ConnectorCall.getRequestHeaders() and getResponseHeaders() now return a ParameterList, other helper methods removed.
 - Added urlEncode() on Parameter.
 - Reference now sets new scheme names in lower case to respect normalization rules.
 - Added more unit tests for the Resltet API; Contributed by Lars Heuer.
 - Fixed bug in Jetty 5 HTTPS connector preventing the usage of the specified SSL keystore in certain cases. Found by Dave Pawson.
 - Added constructors to DefaultServer using the protocol's default port
 
1.0 beta 13 (2006-05-29)
 - Updated StringTemplate and StringTemplateRepresentation to allow the usage of different delimiters for variable insertion and instructions 
   like conditions. The goal is to prevent conflict between variable names and (future) instruction names.
   Now the delimiters must be different and default to ${variableName} and #[if test1]...#[else if test2]...#[else]...#[end].
   WARNING: this has a potential impact on existing application using the old delimiters for instructions such as for the 
   RedirectResltet target URI pattern.
 - Added support for single quotes to delimit the variable names in CallModel instances. Prevents the needs for double quote escaping in Java strings.
 - Enhanced the Reference to strictly conform to the URI RFC 3896. New methods, normalization code, resolution of relative URIs and relativization.
 - GuardChainlet doesn't log the password anymore. Reported by AJ Barnes.
 - Call.setRedirectionRef() and setResourceRef() now accept relative URIs (like ".."). The base URi is the current context. Suggested by Yuri de Wit.
 - Fixed bug in SimpleCall forgetting to add the port number in the request URIs.
 - Optimized response time of the Simple HTTP server connector. Suggested by Niall Gallagher.
 - Added DefaultBuilder.upMaplet() and upMaplet(level) to go up to parent Maplet builders without the need to count non Maplet builders 
   and having to cast.
 - Added new RestletContainerBuilder constructor taking an existing RestletContainer instance.
 - Added empty RestletContainer constructor in case the name is never used.
 - Added HostMapletBuilder to facilitate the fluent configuration of Host Maplets.
 - Fully refactored the Ant build process using macro tasks.
 - Added support for Retroweaver in the build process to backport the classes to older JDKs than 5.0. Contributed by Lars Heuer.
 - Added a build.properties file containing the machine specific directories in order to have a universal build.xml Ant file. Suggested by Lars Heuer.
 - Added new attachHost(domain) method to ChainletBuilder, MapletBuilder and RestletContainerBuilder (refactored other attachHost() methods too).
 - Added "redirectStatus" property to HostMaplet.
 - Added a DOAP description for the Restlet project: http://www.restlet.org/docs/doap
 - Added RDF (APPLICATION_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTION_FRAMEWORK) to org.restlet.data.MediaTypes.
 - Added MapModel.remove() method.
 - Added DirectoryRestlet.addCommonExtensions() method to add common language and media type mappings to file extensions.
 - Added new parameter to DirectoryRestlet constructor to add common extensions.
 - Simplified tutorial examples based on the new addCommonExtensions() method.
 - Fixed bug in HostMaplet causing NPE when redirection to preferred URI was enabled.
 - Greatly simplified the sample application (http://www.restlet.org/sample) by using fluent builders.
 - Added createHost() and attachParent() methods to MapletBuilder and RestletContainerBuilder to delay the attachment (dynamic URI pattern) to the 
   parent Maplet after the complete configuration.
 - Renamed DefaultBuilder into ObjectBuilder.
 - Added BuilderFactory and Builders classes to facilitate the instantiation of builders and their eventual subclassing by applications.
 - Added Reference.equals(Object) and Reference.hashCode() methods. Contributed by Lars Heuer.
 - Fixed bug with Call.getClientAddress() not being consistent with Call.getClientAddresses(). Reported by Lars Heuer.
 - Removed unecessary Call.setClientAddresses(List) method. Use the modifiable list returned by Call.getClientAddresses() instead.

 - Added Reference.getProtocol() and setProtocol() method to manipulate the URI scheme component via the Protocol interface.
 - Added Protocols.create(schemeName) static method to allow reuse of Protocols enums.
 
1.0 beta 12 (2006-05-20)
 - Added com.noelios.restlet.build package containing builder classes allowing a compact construction of Restlet applications base of the Fluent design
	pattern coined by Martin Fowler. Based on suggestion and contribution from Lars Heuer and Yuri de Wit.
 - Added Tutorial 12 illustrating the used of builders to reimplement Tutorial 11.
 - Added buffering to Simple server to solve the performance issue.
 - Removed the Element interface which doesn't bring value to the framework.
 - Renamed "parent" property in Restlet into "owner" to prevent risk of confusion with the tree of Maplets or the tree of builders. 
   Here the owner means the first component ownign or containing the Restlet handler, often a Restlet Container component.
 - Templatized the AbstractRestlet class with a subclass of Call. This way the handle(Get|Put|...) methods directly cast the call to the application's
   specialized Call. This is useful when the application has to enrich the default call using the WrapperCall class as it prevents frequent casts
   and other workarounds such as using a base class. Suggested by Lars Heuer.
 - Renamed CompressChainlet.ALWAYS_ENCODE constant into ENCODE_ALL_SIZES.
 - Added default implementation of GuardChainlet.authorize(Call) method based on a map of login, password couples.
 - When no encoding preferences were provided, we were assuming that all encodings were supported. Now we only assume that the identity encoding is
   supported. Reported by Lars Heuer.

 - Added EncoderRepresentation allowing the transparent encoding of a wrapped representation (supports GZip, Zip and Deflate).
 - Added DecoderRepresentation allowing the transparent decoding of a wrapped representation (supports GZip, Zip and Deflate).
 - Added an ExtractChainlet to extract some attributes from a call (query string parameters, input form parameters, call's template model 
   or context matches). The extracted attributes are available via the Call.getAttributes() map. Suggested by Yuri de Wit.
 - Added TunnelChainlet, subclass of ExtractChainlet that can tunnel method name, accept headers and resource URI for clients unable to make full REST
 	calls (like browsers restricted to GET and POST methods). Suggested by Yuri de Wit. 
 - Added a forward(Call) method to AbstractRestlet to facilitate the internal forwarding and dispatching of calls (similar to Servlet forwarding).
   Suggested by John D. Mitchell.
 - Fixed issue with HTTP client connector when getting the response stream in error cases (404 not found, etc.).
 - The HTTP client connector nows correctly reads the "contentLength" headers and use the value to set the "size" property of the call output object.
 - Fixed bug in Statuses using an invalid code for CONNECTOR_* statuses.
 - Added an "attributes" map to the Call interface that can be used by developers to store information relative to the current call.
 - Added a return parameter to the Maplet.attach() methods to facilitate multiple attachments in a single call. Suggested by Yuri de Wit.
 - Removed getMethods() from the Resource interface as this is the responsability of Restlet handlers.
 - Added "multipart/form" media type to MediaTypes.
 - Do not add anymore the "acceptCharset/Encoding/Language" headers with "*" values if call has no preference defined. Reported by Dave Pawson.
 - Added a finer trace for file not found exceptions caught in Http Client connector. Reported by Dave Pawson.
 - Changed HTTP client to set the JDK's "keep alive" feature to false.
 - Fixed HTTP client bug preventing the reading of the output if no content type was returned. Reported by Dave Pawson.

 - Added clone constructor to RepresentationMetadata.
 - Added WrapperRepresentation to facilitate wrapping of existing representations by application developers.
 - Added entries for all major media types in the MediaTypes enumeration.
 - Added includes() method to MediaType and related classes to facilites comparaison between media type ranges.
   representations. Suggested by John D. Mitchell. Initial code contributed by Lars Heuer.
 - Removed the CASE_INSENSITIVE flag when compiling URI patterns for Maplets. Suggested by Lars Heuer.
 - You can now attach and detach targets while handling incoming calls as the Maplet and Chainlet delegation code is ensured to be thread-safe and atomic.
 - Added detachAll() method to the Maplet interface.
 - Fixed bug preventing the DefaultServer from intercepting the handle(ServerCall) calls. Reported by Lars Heuer.
 - Added new attach() methods to Maplet taking an additional "override" parameter to make attachments with a higher priority than existing ones.
   Suggested by Roger Wallace.
 - Factorized some HTTP header parsing into Methods.create() and PreferenceUtils
 - Added support for getting of connector call request/response headers from the CallModel (call's template model). 
   Useful for the TunnelChainlet to extract "X-HTTP-Method-Override" headers for example.
 - Added HEADER_X_HTTP_METHOD_OVERRIDE to ConnectorCall. This is specified by Google Data APIs.
 - Updated Jetty 6 to beta 16 version.
 - Renamed FreeMarkerRepresentation.getValues() to getDataModel() for consistency with the setDataModel() method. Reported by Lars Heuer.
 
1.0 beta 10 (2006-05-02)
 - Fully refactored the org.restlet.data package to reduce usage of interfaces and remove the need to use the Manager static methods
   whose implementation would not significantly vary from one implementation to another. When interfaces were needed, like for enumerations, 
   the implementation class is provided with the Default* name. Inspired by a discussion with Henry Story.
 - Merged Manager class and Factory interface into a single Factory class.
 - Renamed RestletCall interface into Call for further simplification (was UniformCall in beta 8).

 - Added org.restlet.DefaultCall to replace calls to Manager.createCall().
 - Added a HostMaplet to provide an easy and flexible way to detect the URI related to a single host such as equivalent IP-based URIs. 
   All aspects are configurable and there is choice between two attachment modes (parent Chainlet or Maplet). 
   Suggested by Dave Pawson and John D. Mitchell.
 - The RestletContainer now also implements the Chainlet interface, in addition to the Maplet interface. 
   If you use both attachment mechanisms at the same time, the Chainlet will have a higher priority. 
   This is a convenient way to chain a Restlet as a root handler with having to specify a URI pattern (ex: logging, HostMaplet attachment). 
 - Added org.restlet.connector.DefaultClient and DefaultServer to replace calls to Manager.createClient() and createServer().
 - Renamed RestletCallWrapper into WrapperCall for consistency purpose.
 - Renamed UniformCallModel into CallModel for consistency with Call interface naming.

   This uses the new statuses:CONNECTOR_ERROR_CONNECTION, CONNECTOR_ERROR_COMMUNICATION and CONNECTOR_ERROR_INTERNAL.
 - Added "timeout" property to the Client connector interface. Default and infinite timeouts can be specified. Suggested by Dave Pawson.
 - Renamed "httpCode" property to "code" for the Status interface.
 - The content length of posted/put representations is now available when received by the HTTP connectors (based on Content-Length header availability).
 - Changed the Component "initParameters" property type to Map<String, String> instead of List<Parameter> for easier parameter value retrieval.

 - Fixed typo in the TraceTarget debugging Restlet.
 - Updated tutorial and sample application to match the latest API changes.

1.0 beta 8 (2006-04-10)
 - Fully decoupled the connectors from the Restlet implementation. NRE now autodiscovers the connectors on your classpath 
   (order matters when multiple connectors are supporting the same protocol). As a consequence, you no longer need the 
   Jetty and JavaMail classes on your classpath if you don't need them because the NRE factory doesn't contain anymore 
   hardcoded reference to concrete connector classes.
 - Added DomRepresentation to NRE data package, a representation based on a DOM document

 - Added a better toString() implementation for Status instances (suggested by Jerome Bernard)
 - HTTP client connector was not setting the "content-length" header when sending an input representation (reported by Jerome Bernard)
 - Fixed Java Service Wrapper default configuration (library paths broken and no default main class). No it starts the third
   tutorial example. Thanks to Daniel Einspanjer for reporting the bug and suggesting the default service.
 - Refactored GuardChainlet to separate the concepts of authentication and authorization and make each step optional. More hooks 
   provided to implement custom authentication schemes based on cookies, query params or IP addresses for example. Suggested by A.J. Barnes.
 - Added "login", "password" and "role" properties to the SecurityData interface. Used by the GuardChainlet if authentication succeeds.
 	Can also be modified and accessed by the application to manage user roles and resource level access authorizations.

0.11 beta (2005-11-29)
 - Renamed JettyConnector to JettyServer
 - Removed unnecessary HttpServer interface
 - Replaced many RestletException by IOException in non Restlet specific classes and interfaces
 - TemplateRepresentation no longer load the template upon creation as recommanded for performance reasons
 - Completed the separation between the Resltet API and the implementations: added org.restlet.Factory interface and org.restlet.Manager class.
 - Restlet API implementations must register their implementation of org.restlet.Factory with the org.restlet.Manager before usage.
 - Renamed CallImpl to UniformCallImpl

0.10 beta (2005-11-17)
 - Renamed all Default* classes in com.noelios.restlet into *Impl for clarity purpose.
 - Added Status.getUri() method and improved Status.getDescription().
 - Removed the NONE values from Status and Method enumerations, null is doing a better job.

   and setting is available in a way that hides technical names and extensions, allowing a clean content negotiation.
 - Fixed issue with character encoding in the TemplateRepresentation (FreeMarker integration).
 - Moved FileResource and FileRestlet to com.noelios.restlet
 - Refactored the Jetty HTTP server connector to bypass their HTTP handler layer. Now we directly work out of the Jetty SocketListener and 
   HttpConnection class. This will improve performances and reduce the memory consumed. Note that version 5.1.5 of Jetty is required as it 
   contains a necessary fix.
 - Moved classes in com.noelios.restlet.ext.jse into com.noelios.restlet (restlets, FileResource), com.noelios.restlet.data (representations 
   and readers) or com.noelios.restlet.ext.jee (JDBC).
 - Refactored com.noelios.restelt.RestletMappings into com.noelios.MapletImpl and used it as a delegate in org.restlet.DefaultMaplet.

 - Separated Method into Method, Methods and DefaultMethod to allow any method. Added getUri() method.
 - Separated CharacterSet into CharacterSet and CharacterSets.
 - Separated Language into Language and Languages.
 - Added all HTTP and WebDAV methods in Methods.
 - Separated Status into Status, Statuses and Default Status to allow any status. 
 - Variant interface was renamed RepresentationMetadata to remove ambiguity. Also added "expirationDate", "modificationDate" and "tag" properties.
 - Added Tag interface and TagImpl for cache validation purpose.
 - Instead of deriving Variant, Representation now has a getMetadata() method returning an instance of RepresentationMetadata.
 - Added all existing HTTP and WebDAV statuses in Statuses.
 - Added a setTemporaryRedirect() method to UniformCall.
 - Upgraded the JDBC Client to support multiple databases, drivers and connection pools.


0.9 beta (2005-11-01)
 - Moved com.restlet into com.noelios.restlet

 - Allowed multiple invocations of the DefaultForm.getFormReader() method when it is possible to reset the underlying input stream.
 - Added a logging in com.noelios.restlet.ext.jetty.RestletHandler using java.util.logging mechanism.
 - Refactored all code to use J2SE 5.0 language features (generics, enums)
 - Added Status and Method enumerations in org.restlet.data
 - Renamed Call to UniformCall
 - Added a RestletCall interface which extends UniformCall with a flexible way to get the path of each restlet in the stack of restlets that handled 
   the call so far.
 - Added a org.restlet.data.Reference interface to work around the limitation of java.net.URI which is not a mutable class.
 - Moved Resource and Restlet interfaces at the root level (org.restlet). 
 - Refactored the UniformInterface. Many methods where moved to the Reference interface. Added "referrerURI" and "resourceURI" properties.
 - Separated the Restlet interface into Maplet and Restlet. Maplets are specialized restlets capable of delegating restlet calls to child restlets. 
   RestletContainer now extends Maplet.
 - Renamed DefaultRestlet into AbstractRestlet.

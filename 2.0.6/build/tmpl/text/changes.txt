             "user : User", "roles : List<Role>" and "principals" to 
             remove the JAAS dependency.
           - A new JAAS extension was added, where the JaasVerifier, 
             DefaultCallbackHandler, UserPrincipal and RolePrincipal
             classes where moved.
           - Verifier now uses ClientInfo as parameter instead of
             Subject.

             static method. Suggested by Rickard Oberg.
           - Enroler and Verifier are now interfaces.
             Suggested by Rickard Oberg.

             field as specified in RFC 2617.
           - Renamed HttpDigestAuthenticator into a more generic 
             DigestAuthenticator.
           - Made the HTTP DIGEST work again on the server-side, via 
             DigestAuthenticator. Issue reported by Carsten Lohmann.

          more naming consistency with filters.
        - Added conveniency constructors to Server.
        - ResourceException is now a RuntimeException to facilitate its
          usage with dynamic proxies created by ClientResource#create()
          static methods and wrap() methods.

          return a Representation to ClientResource.
        - The Router class now has those default values:
           - "defaultMatchingMode" : MODE_EQUALS instead of STARTS_WITH
           - "defaultMatchQuery" : false
           - "routingMode" : FIRST instead of BEST
          Note that for easier configuration, the router detects the
          attachment of Directory instances and automatically uses a 
          MODE_START_WITH mode in this case.
        - Added "org.restlet.ext.crypto" extension including many digest
          related features such as Amazon S3 and Azure client HTTP
          authentication. This removes the dependency from the Restlet
          core to javax.crypto.
        - Improved the Resolver class to expose call attributes as 
          objects instead of string for easier integration with template 
          engines such as FreeMarker.

          Client class like the GWT edition already had. 
        - Refactored the GWT edition to be more inline with the other 
          editions. Especially, we ported the ClientResource class.
        - Added ClientInfo#from property corresponding to the "From" HTTP
          header.
        - Added Response#age and #retryAfter properties corresponding to 
          the "Age" and "Retry-After" HTTP headers.
        - Added Message#date property corresponding to the "Date" HTTP 
          header. Suggested by Carlos Alexandre Moscoso.
        - Added org.restlet.data.Warning class and Message#warnings 
          property corresponding to the "Warning" HTTP header.
        - Added HTTP warning status codes to the Status class.

        - Moved Message, Request and Response classes from the
          org.restlet.data to the org.restlet package as they are
          core artifacts of the API used in Uniform interface.
        - Deprecated Redirector.MODE_DISPATCHER to introduce support
          for MODE_CLIENT_DISPATCHER and MODE_SERVER_DISPATCHER.
        - ServerResource#getPreferredVariant() is now protected.

        - Added "inboundRoot" and "outboundRoot" properties to 
          Application and deprecated the "root" property and the 
          createRoot() method. The outbound root, is the hook for 
          client-side routing and points by default to the context's 
          client dispatcher, but can be changed by the user to do 
          custom routing/filtering. New createInboundRoot() and 
          createOutboundRoot() methods can be overriden.
        - The ServerResource#getVariants() method now returns a 
          modifiable list of variants instead of a map.
        - Refactored the ServerResource class so that annotated methods

        - Fixed integration issue with Tomcat due to the GC releasing
          Restlet representations, indirectly closing the underlying
          Tomcat buffer which could have been reused for another 
          request, causing unexpected socket reading issues.
          Initially reported by Denys Hryvastov.
        - Fixed issues preventing SpringFinder and SpringBeanFinder

          Context#setServerDispatcher() methods.
        - Added support for proxy authentication in the Restlet API.
          Added "proxyChallengeResponse" property to Request, added
          "proxyChallengeRequests" to Response. Added support in the
          HTTP parsing and formatting layers.
        - Added a WadlApplication#createFinder() method to facilitate
          customization of behavior with Spring. 
          Suggested by Rhett Sutphin.
        - Added Protocol#ZIP constant.
        - Representation#finalize() method now has a default 
          implementation that calls the release() method.
          Suggested by Remi Dewitte.
        - Updated accept.properties file, removing Firefox 
          customization as version 3.0 has proper 'Accept' header.
        - Added a JaxbRepresentation#setValidationEventHandler method.
        - Added Variant#isCompatible() method.
        - Added an org.restlet.representation.RepresentationInfo class
          that contains the "lastModified" and "tags" properties from
          Representation which is now a subclass. Variant is the super
          class. Useful to check conditions without pulling a full
          representation. Suggested by Lars Heuer. 
        - Added Method.ALL constant. Useful to declare variants common
          to all methods in the new ServerResource class.
        - Added new org.restlet.routing package and moved Filter, 
          Router, Redirector and subclasses to it.
        - Moved Directory, Finder and Handler to org.restlet.resource
          package.
        - Renamed org.restlet.security.Guard to UniformGuard in order to

- 1.2 Milestone 1 (2009-01-23)
    - Breaking changes
        - The engine has been moved from "com.noelios.restlet" to
          the "org.restlet.engine" package, simplifying the packaging.
        - All engine extensions have been moved to "org.restlet.ext"
          packages.
        - The com.noelios.restlet.ext.spring extension has been merged
          with org.restlet.ext.spring.
        - Moved org.restlet.util.DateUtils, ByteUtils and Engine 
          classes to org.restlet.engine.* packages.
    - Enhancements
        - Internal HTTP connector now supports HTTPS connections.
          Contributed by Kevin Conaway.
        - Added a Lucene extension including a Solr client connector
          contributed by Remi Dewitte. Also contains a useful 
          TikaRepresentation to extract metadata from a representation
          using Lucene Tika parsing and analysis library. Suggested by
          Ben Johnson.
        - The Atom Service class now supports getting documents from
          other protocols than HTTP.
        - Updated org.restlet.Component to support validating parsing. 
          Contributed by Raif S. Naffah.
        - XmlRepresentation now has "entityResolver", "errorHandler", 
          "schema", "xIncludeAware" and "validating" properties. 
          Contributed by Raif S. Naffah.
    - API changes
        - A response with a 200 (Ok) status should have an entity. Now,
          we make sure that a warning is logged. 
          Reported by Rob Heittman.
        - Removed all code deprecated in the Restlet 1.1 release.
        - Added org.restlet.data.Literal to represent RDF
          literals with an optional datatype. 
        - Added org.restlet.data.Link to represent RDF links (aka 
          triples, statements or relationships).
        - Moved o.r.u.Helper class, used privately by API classes to 
          the o.r.engine package.
        - Added MediaType constants APPLICATION_RDF_TRIG, 
          APPLICATION_RDF_TRIX, APPLICATION_RDF_TURTLE, 
          APPLICATION_SPARQL_RESULTS_XML and
          APPLICATION_SPARQL_RESULTS_JSON for RDF and SPARQL.
        - Added LinkReference and LinkSet classes to support RDF 
          reference manipulation (blank nodes for example) and RDF 
          graphs or models.
        - Added CharacterSet#DEFAULT constant, new constructor for 
          Charset instances and a toCharset() method. Suggested by
          Charles Gay.
        - Added Reference#toUri(), toUrl() and constructors from 
          java.net.URI and URL instances. Suggested by Cliff Binstock.

          deprecated APPLICATION_ATOM_XML.          
        - Added APPLICATION_ATOM_SERVICE_XML media type constant and 
          deprecated APPLICATION_ATOMPUB_SERVICE.
        - Added APPLICATION_ATOMPUB_CATEGORY media type constant.
        - Added APPLICATION_KML and APPLICATION_KMZ media type 
          constants. Suggested by Frank Hellwig.          
        - Added APPLICATION_MATHML_XML media type constant and 
          deprecated APPLICATION_MATHML.
        - Added APPLICATION_RSS_XML media type constant and 
          deprecated APPLICATION_RSS.
        - Added APPLICATION_W3C_SCHEMA_XML media type constant and 
          deprecated APPLICATION_W3C_SCHEMA.
        - Added APPLICATION_WADL_XML media type constant and 
          deprecated APPLICATION_WADL.
        - Added APPLICATION_XHTML_XML media type constant and 
          deprecated APPLICATION_XHTML.
        - MediaType constructor now normalizes the main and sub parts.
          If invalid characters are detected, an IllegalArgumentExcept
          is thrown. Spaces are also trimmed and empty parts are 
          converted to '*'. Contributed by Nicolas Rinaudo.
        - Method#setUri() has been deprecated as Method instances 
          shouldn't be modifiable.
        - Language.getSubTags() now returns an unmodifiable list.
        - MediaType.parameters property is now unmodifiable. Initial
          issue reported by Nicolas Rinaudo. 
        - Added static Series#unmodifiableSeries() method.
        - Added DateUtils.format(Date) method which uses HTTP default
          format.
        - Added a new "org.restlet.security" package with a full
          replacement for current Guard mechanism. This is
          an alpha level package not intended for Restlet users yet.
        - Made the SpringBeanRouter implement ApplicationContextAware
          to enable AOP on target resources. Suggested by Daniel Woo.
        - Resource subclasses can now declared variants and match them
          more easily using an automatic detection mechanism based on
          represent*() methods where '*' is a series of extensions. 
          Also added a "detectVariants" property to turn off this
          behavior if necessary.
        - Added a getAllMetadata(String extension) method on the
          MetadataService class. 
        - Deprecated the ClientInfo#addresses property and replaced it
          by a more explicit "forwardedAddresses" property. Also, added
          a new getUpstreamAddress() method. Adjusted the Resolver 
          class to add a new "ciua" variable. Change suggested by 
          John D. Mitchell. Initial patch provided by Remi Dewitte.
        - Added ClientInfo#subject property returning a JAAS Subject.
          Can contain several principals and credentials. Deprecated 
          the ChallengeResponse#getPrincipal() method.
        - Added new Conditions.getStatus() method signature for usage
          by the JAX-RS extension. Suggested by Stephan Koops.
    - Misc
        - JAX-RS extension:
            - added class ExendedUriBuilder with "file" extensions for
              content negotiation and an ExtendedUriInfo to get it.
            - Supports per-request-providers now.
            - JaxRsApplication will not clear the MetadataService (as
              before; was required to not use other extensions as given
              in the JAX-RS ApplicationConfig class).
        - The Directory class doesn't override the findTarget() method
          but uses the default Finder mechanism based on the 
          "targetClass" property. Therefore, it is easier to specify a
          subclass of org.restlet.engine.local.DirectoryResource in
          order to customize the default behavior. 
          Suggested by Cliff Binstock.
        - Upgraded db4o to version 7.7.67.
        - Refactored engine support for the StatusService. Removed
          ApplicationStatusFilter and ComponentStatusFilter.
        - Extracted all internal classes of ByteUtils into the new
          org.restlet.engine.io package for easier reuse and 
          maintenance.
        - Clarified Javadocs in Reference#getPath() methods.
        - Fixed potential NPE in Reference#decode() method.
        - Clarified Javadocs in FileRepresentation and methods 
          Representation#getDownloadName(), setDownloadName() in order
          to explain that setDownloadable(true) must be called first.
          Issue reported by Kevin Conaway.
        - The internal HTTP client doesn't send absolute request URIs
          anymore. It now sends them as relative URIs according to the
          HTTP 1.1 specification. Reported by Jonas Maturana Larsen.
        - Upgraded Apache Commons IO to version 1.4.
        - The ServerServlet now sets the HTTP headers after the status
          to prevent issues with Tomcat 5.0 and "Content-Length: 0" 
          headers sending the response immediately. 
          Reported by Eirik Bjorsnos. 
        - The internal HTTP client no longer forces the user agent name
          if one has already been specified by the user. Contributed by
          Kevin Conaway.

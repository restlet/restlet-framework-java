"JavaBeans Activation Framework (JAF) is a standard extension to the Java 
platform that lets you take advantage of standard services to: determine the 
type of an arbitrary piece of data; encapsulate access to it; discover the 
operations available on it; and instantiate the appropriate bean to perform the 
operation(s)."

ROME - Parsing, generating and publishing RSS and Atom feeds
------------------------------------------------------------

"ROME is an set of open source Java tools for parsing, generating and 
publishing RSS and Atom feeds. The core ROME library depends only on the 
JDOM XML parser and supports parsing, generating and converting all of 
the popular RSS and Atom formats including RSS 0.90, RSS 0.91 Netscape, 
RSS 0.91 Userland, RSS 0.92, RSS 0.93, RSS 0.94, RSS 1.0, RSS 2.0, 
Atom 0.3, and Atom 1.0. You can parse to an RSS object model, an Atom 
object model or an abstract SyndFeed model that can model either family 
of formats."

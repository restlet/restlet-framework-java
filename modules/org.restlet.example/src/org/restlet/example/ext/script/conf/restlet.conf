// Server
//
// Restlet is decoupled from the actual server implementation. By default a
// basic server is provided, but it is recommended that you use a more robust
// server, such as Jetty or Grizzly, via a connector extension. To enable an
// alternate server, simply add its jars to your Java classpath (you can do
// this in wrapper.conf). 
//

// The TCP port on which the server will start. Note that the Restlet server can
// be set up to run behind another web server via a proxy. For Apache, this
// requires mod_proxy.

// Resources
//
// Sets up a directory under which you can place script files that implement
// RESTful resources. The directory structure underneath the base directory
// is directly linked to the base URL.

// you to use the directory structure to create nice URLs without relying
// on filenames.

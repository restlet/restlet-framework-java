Support the WADL specification. WADL allows you to describe your
applications RESTfully.
<br>
This extension allows you to configure a Restlet component or
application based on a WADL/XML document or to dynamically generate the
WADL/XML document of an existing Restlet application. It also knows how
to convert this WADL/XML document into a user friendly HTML document.

Support for JSON representations. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation and is a lightweight 
data-interchange format. This extension is based on the JSON library from Java providing
by the official JSON.org Web site. This library is useful in simple cases, but not tuned
for performance or extensive serialization support of POJOs. If you need such features,
you can also consider the XStream extension which supports both XML and JSON serialization.

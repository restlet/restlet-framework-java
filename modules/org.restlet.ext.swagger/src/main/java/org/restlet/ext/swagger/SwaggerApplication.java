 * It requires you to set up a specific end point that serves the resource

 * resource.<br>
 * <br>
 * By default, nothing is required. This application adds to its inbound root

 * SwaggerApplication#attachSwagger* methods<br>

 * By default, both descriptions are generated by introspecting the application
 * itself. You can override this behavior by specifying your own implementation
 * of {@link SwaggerSpecificationRestlet}.
